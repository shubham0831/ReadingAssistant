    "userPrompt": "this from erupting into general conflagration, to salvage what we can of the\nkey bloodlines.\u201d\nJessica closed her eyes, feeling tears press out beneath the lids. She fought\ndown the inner trembling, the outer trembling, the uneven breathing, the\nragged pulse, the sweating of the palms. Presently, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll pay for my\nown mistake.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your son will pay with you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll shield him as well as I\u2019m able.\u201d\n\u201cShield!\u201d the old woman snapped. \u201cYou well know the weakness there!\nShield your son too much, Jessica, and he\u2019ll not grow strong enough to fulfill\nany destiny.\u201d\nJessica turned away, looked out the window at the gathering darkness. \u201cIs\nit really that terrible, this planet of Arrakis?\u201d\n\u201cBad enough, but not all bad. The Missionaria Protectiva has been in there\nand softened it up somewhat.\u201d The Reverend Mother heaved herself to her\nfeet, straightened a fold in her gown. \u201cCall the boy in here. I must be leaving\nsoon.\u201d\n\u201cMust you?\u201d\nThe old woman\u2019s voice softened. \u201cJessica, girl, I wish I could stand in your\nplace and take your sufferings. But each of us must make her own path.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re as dear to me as any of my own daughters, but I cannot let that\ninterfere with duty.\u201d\n\u201cI understand ... the necessity.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you did, Jessica, and why you did it\u2014we both know. But kindness\nforces me to tell you there\u2019s little chance your lad will be the Bene Gesserit\nTotality. You mustn\u2019t let yourself hope too much.\u201d\nJessica shook tears from the corners of her eyes. It was an angry gesture.\n\u201cYou make me feel like a little girl again\u2014reciting my first lesson.\u201d She\nforced the words out: \u201c \u2018Humans must never submit to animals.\u2019 \u201d A dry sob\nshook her. In a low voice, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve been so lonely.\u201d\n\u201cIt should be one of the tests,\u201d the old woman said. \u201cHumans are almost\nalways lonely. Now summon the boy. He\u2019s had a long, frightening day. But\nhe\u2019s had time to think and remember, and I must ask the other questions\nabout these dreams of his.\u201d\nJessica nodded, went to the door of the Meditation Chamber, opened it.\n\u201cPaul, come in now, please.\u201d\nPaul emerged with a stubborn slowness. He stared at his mother as though\nshe were a stranger. Wariness veiled his eyes when he glanced at the\nReverend Mother, but this time he nodded to her, the nod one gives an equal.\nHe heard his mother close the door behind him.\n\u201cYoung man,\u201d the old woman said, \u201clet\u2019s return to this dream business.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u201cDo you dream every night?\u201d\n\u201cNot dreams worth remembering. I can remember every dream, but some\nare worth remembering and some aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know the difference?\u201d\n\u201cI just know it.\u201d\nThe old woman glanced at Jessica, back to Paul. \u201cWhat did you dream last\nnight? Was it worth remembering?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Paul closed his eyes. \u201cI dreamed a cavern ... and water ... and a girl\nthere\u2014very skinny with big eyes. Her eyes are all blue, no whites in them. I\ntalk to her and tell her about you, about seeing the Reverend Mother on\nCaladan.\u201d Paul opened his eyes.\n\u201cAnd the thing you tell this strange girl about seeing me, did it happen\ntoday?\u201d\nPaul thought about this, then: \u201cYes. I tell the girl you came and put a stamp\nof strangeness on me.\u201d\n\u201cStamp of strangeness,\u201d the old woman breathed, and again she shot a\nglance at Jessica, returned her attention to Paul. \u201cTell me truly now, Paul, do\nyou often have dreams of things that happen afterward exactly as you\ndreamed them?\u201d\n\u201cYes. And I\u2019ve dreamed about that girl before.\u201d\n\u201cOh? You know her?\u201d\n\u201cI will know her.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about her.\u201d\nAgain, Paul closed his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re in a little place in some rocks where\nit\u2019s sheltered. It\u2019s almost night, but it\u2019s hot and I can see patches of sand out\nof an opening in the rocks. We\u2019re... waiting for something ... for me to go\nmeet some people. And she\u2019s frightened but trying to hide it from me, and\nI\u2019m excited. And she says: \u2018Tell me about the waters of your homeworld,\nUsul.\u2019 \u201d Paul opened his eyes. \u201cIsn\u2019t that strange? My homeworld\u2019s Caladan.\nI\u2019ve never even heard of a planet called Usul.\u201d\n\u201cIs there more to this dream?\u201d Jessica prompted.\n\u201cYes. But maybe she was calling me Usul,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI just thought of\nthat.\u201d Again, he closed his eyes. \u201cShe asks me to tell her about the waters.\nAnd I take her hand. And I say I\u2019ll tell her a poem. And I tell her the poem,\nbut I have to explain some of the words\u2014like beach and surf and seaweed\nand seagulls.\u201d\n\u201cWhat poem?\u201d the Reverend Mother asked.\nPaul opened his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of Gurney Halleck\u2019s tone poems for\nsad times.\u201d\nBehind Paul, Jessica began to recite:\n\u201cI remember salt smoke from a beach fire \nAnd shadows under the pines\u2014\nSolid, clean ... fixed\u2014\nSeagulls perched at the tip of land, \nWhite upon green ... \nAnd a wind comes through the pines \nTo sway the shadows; \nThe seagulls spread their wings, \nLift \nAnd fill the sky with screeches. \nAnd I hear the wind \nBlowing across our beach, \nAnd the surf, \nAnd I see that our fire \nHas scorched the seaweed.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one,\u201d Paul said.\nThe old woman stared at Paul, then: \u201cYoung man, as a Proctor of the Bene\nGesserit, I seek the Kwisatz Haderach, the male who truly can become one of\nus. Your mother sees this possibility in you, but she sees with the eyes of a\nmother. Possibility I see, too, but no more.\u201d\nShe fell silent and Paul saw that she wanted him to speak. He waited her\nout.\nPresently, she said: \u201cAs you will, then. You\u2019ve depths in you; that I\u2019ll\ngrant.\u201d\n\u201cMay I go now?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to hear what the Reverend Mother can tell you about the\nKwisatz Haderach?\u201d Jessica asked.\n\u201cShe said those who tried for it died.\u201d\n\u201cBut I can help you with a few hints at why they failed,\u201d the Reverend\nMother said.\nShe talks of hints, Paul thought. She doesn\u2019t really know anything. And he\nsaid: \u201cHint then.\u201d\n\u201cAnd be damned to me?\u201d She smiled wryly, a crisscross of wrinkles in the\nold face. \u201cVery well: \u2018That which submits rules.\u2019 \u201d\nHe felt astonishment: she was talking about such elementary things as\ntension within meaning. Did she think his mother had taught him nothing at\nall?\n\u201cThat\u2019s a hint?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to bandy words or quibble over their meaning,\u201d the old\nwoman said. \u201cThe willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is\nmany willows\u2014a wall against the wind. This is the willow\u2019s purpose.\u201d\nPaul stared at her. She said purpose and he felt the word buffet him,\nreinfecting him with terrible purpose. He experienced a sudden anger at her:\nfatuous old witch with her mouth full of platitudes.\n\u201cYou think I could be this Kwisatz Haderach,\u201d he said. \u201cYou talk about\nme, but you haven\u2019t said one thing about what we can do to help my father.\nI\u2019ve heard you talking to my mother. You talk as though my father were\ndead. Well, he isn\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cIf there were a thing to be done for him, we\u2019d have done it,\u201d the old\nwoman growled. \u201cWe may be able to salvage you. Doubtful, but possible.\nBut for your father, nothing. When you\u2019ve learned to accept that as a fact,\nyou\u2019ve learned a real Bene Gesserit lesson.\u201d\nPaul saw how the words shook his mother. He glared at the old woman.\nHow could she say such a thing about his father? What made her so sure? His\nmind seethed with resentment.\nThe Reverend Mother looked at Jessica. \u201cYou\u2019ve been training him in the\nWay\u2014I\u2019ve seen the signs of it. I\u2019d have done the same in your shoes and\ndevil take the Rules.\u201d\nJessica nodded.\n\u201cNow, I caution you,\u201d said the old woman, \u201cto ignore the regular order of\ntraining. His own safety requires the Voice. He already has a good start in it,\nbut we both know how much more he needs ... and that desperately.\u201d She\nstepped close to Paul, stared down at him. \u201cGoodbye, young human. I hope\nyou make it. But if you don\u2019t\u2014well, we shall yet succeed.\u201d\nOnce more she looked at Jessica. A flicker sign of understanding passed\nbetween them. Then the old woman swept from the room, her robes hissing,\nwith not another backward glance. The room and its occupants already were\nshut from her thoughts.\nBut Jessica had caught one glimpse of the Reverend Mother\u2019s face as she\nturned away. There had been tears on the seamed cheeks. The tears were\nmore unnerving than any other word or sign that had passed between them\nthis day.\nYou h ave read that Muad\u2018Dib had no playmates his own\nage on Caladan. The dangers were too great. But Muad\u2019Dib\ndid have wonderful companion-teachers. There was Gurney\nHalleck, the trou-badour-warrior. You will sing some of\nGurney\u2019s songs as you read along in this book. There was\nThufir Hawat, the old Mentat Master of Assassins, who struck\nfear even into the heart of the Padishah Emperor. There were\nDuncan Idaho, the Swordmaster of the Ginaz; Dr. Wellington\nYueh, a name black in treachery but bright in knowledge; the\nLady Jessica, who guided her son in the Bene Gesserit Way,\nand\u2014ofcourse\u2014theDuke Leto, whose qualities as a father have\nlong been overlooked.\n\u2014from\u201cA Child\u2019s History of Muad\u2019Dib\u201d by the Princess Irulan\nTHUFIR HAWAT slipped into the training room of Castle Caladan, closed\nthe door softly. He stood there a moment, feeling old and tired and storm-\nleathered. His left leg ached where it had been slashed once in the service of\nthe Old Duke.\nThree generations of them now, he thought.\nHe stared across the big room bright with the light of noon pouring through\nthe skylights, saw the boy seated with back to the door, intent on papers and\ncharts spread across an ell table.\nHow many times must I tell that lad never to settle himself with his back to\na door? Hawat cleared his throat.\nPaul remained bent over his studies.\nA cloud shadow passed over the skylights. Again, Hawat cleared his\nthroat.\nPaul straightened, spoke without turning: \u201cI know. I\u2019m sitting with my\nback to a door.\u201d\nHawat suppressed a smile, strode across the room.\nPaul looked up at the grizzled old man who stopped at a corner of the\ntable. Hawat\u2019s eyes were two pools of alertness in a dark and deeply seamed\nface.\n\u201cI heard you coming down the hall,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd I heard you open the\ndoor.\u201d\n\u201cThe sounds I make could be imitated.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d know the difference.\u201d\nHe might at that, Hawat thought. That witch-mother of his is giving him\nthe deep training, certainly. I wonder what her precious school thinks of\nthat? Maybe that\u2019s why they sent the old Proctor here\u2014towhip our dear Lady\nJessica into line.\nHawat pulled up a chair across from Paul, sat down facing the door. He did\nit pointedly, leaned back and studied the room. It struck him as an odd place\nsuddenly, a stranger-place with most of its hardware already gone off to\nArrakis. A training table remained, and a fencing mirror with its crystal\nprisms quiescent, the target dummy beside it patched and padded, looking\nlike an ancient foot soldier maimed and battered in the wars.\nThere stand I, Hawat thought.\n\u201cThufir, what\u2019re you thinking?\u201d Paul asked.\nHawat looked at the boy. \u201cI was thinking we\u2019ll all be out of here soon and\nlikely never see the place again.\u201d\n\u201cDoes that make you sad?\u201d\n\u201cSad? Nonsense! Parting with friends is a sadness. A place is only a\nplace.\u201d He glanced at the charts on the table. \u201cAnd Arrakis is just another\nplace.\u201d\n\u201cDid my father send you up to test me?\u201d\nHawat scowled\u2014the boy had such observing ways about him. He nodded.\n\u201cYou\u2019re thinking it\u2019d have been nicer if he\u2019d come up himself, but you must\nknow how busy he is. He\u2019ll be along later.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been studying about the storms on Arrakis.\u201d\n\u201cThe storms. I see.\u201d\n\u201cThey sound pretty bad.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s too cautious a word: bad. Those storms build up across six or\nseven thousand kilometers of flatlands, feed on anything that can give them a\npush\u2014coriolis force, other storms, anything that has an ounce of energy in it.\nThey can blow up to seven hundred kilometers an hour, loaded with\neverything loose that\u2019s in their way\u2014sand, dust, everything. They can eat\nflesh off bones and etch the bones to slivers.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they have weather control?\u201d\n\u201cArrakis has special problems, costs are higher, and there\u2019d be\nmaintenance and the like. The Guild wants a dreadful high price for satellite\ncontrol and your father\u2019s House isn\u2019t one of the big rich ones, lad. You know\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever seen the Fremen?\u201d\nThe lad\u2019s mind is darting all over today, Hawat thought.\n\u201cLike as not I have seen them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s little to tell them from the\nfolk of the graben and sink. They all wear those great flowing robes. And\nthey stink to heaven in any closed space. It\u2019s from those suits they wear\u2014call\nthem \u2018stulsuits\u2019\u2014that reclaim the body\u2019s own water.\u201d\nPaul swallowed, suddenly aware of the moisture in his mouth,\nremembering a dream of thirst. That people could want so for water they had\nto recycle their body moisture struck him with a feeling of desolation.\n\u201cWater\u2019s precious there,\u201d he said.\nHawat nodded, thinking: Perhaps I\u2019m doing it, getting across to him the\nimportance of this planet as an enemy. It\u2019s madness to go in there without\nthat caution in our minds.\nPaul looked up at the skylight, aware that it had begun to rain. He saw the\nspreading wetness on the gray meta-glass. \u201cWater,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll learn a great concern for water,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cAs the Duke\u2019s son\nyou\u2019ll never want for it, but you\u2019ll see the pressures of thirst all around you.\u201d\nPaul wet his lips with his tongue, thinking back to the day a week ago and\nthe ordeal with the Reverend Mother. She, too, had said something about\nwater starvation.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll learn about the funeral plains,\u201d she\u2019d said, \u201cabout the wilderness\nthat is empty, the wasteland where nothing lives except the spice and the\nsandworms. You\u2019ll stain your eyepits to reduce the sun glare. Shelter will\nmean a hollow out of the wind and hidden from view. You\u2019ll ride upon your\nown two feet without \u2018thopter or groundcar or mount.\u201d\nAnd Paul had been caught more by her tone\u2014singsong and wavering\u2014\nthan by her words.\n\u201cWhen you live upon Arrakis,\u201d she had said, \u201ckhala, the land is empty. The\nmoons will be your friends, the sun your enemy.\u201d\nPaul had sensed his mother come up beside him away from her post\nguarding the door. She had looked at the Reverend Mother and asked: \u201cDo\nyou see no hope, Your Reverence?\u201d\n\u201cNot for the father.\u201d And the old woman had waved Jessica to silence,\nlooked down at Paul. \u201cGrave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported\nby four things....\u201d She held up four big-knuckled fingers. \u201c... the learning of\nthe wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of\nthe brave. But all of these are as nothing....\u201d She closed her fingers into a fist.\n\u201c... without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your\ntradition!\u201d\nA week had passed since that day with the Reverend Mother. Her words\nwere only now beginning to come into full register. Now, sitting in the\ntraining room with Thufir Hawat, Paul felt a sharp pang of fear. He looked\nacross at the Mentat\u2019s puzzled frown.\n\u201cWhere were you woolgathering that time?\u201d Hawat asked.\n\u201cDid you meet the Reverend Mother?\u201d\n\u201cThat Truthsayer witch from the Imperium?\u201d Hawat\u2019s eyes quickened with\ninterest. \u201cI met her.\u201d\n\u201cShe....\u201d Paul hesitated, found that he couldn\u2019t tell Hawat about the ordeal.\nThe inhibitions went deep.\n\u201cYes? What did she?\u201d\nPaul took two deep breaths. \u201cShe said a thing.\u201d He closed his eyes, calling\nup the words, and when he spoke his voice unconsciously took on some of\nthe old woman\u2019s tone: \u201c \u2018You, Paul Atreides, descendant of kings, son of a\nDuke, you must learn to rule. It\u2019s something none of your ancestors learned.\u2019\n\u201d Paul opened his eyes, said: \u201cThat made me angry and I said my father rules\nan entire planet. And she said, \u2018He\u2019s losing it.\u2019 And I said my father was\ngetting a richer planet. And she said. \u2018He\u2019ll lose that one, too.\u2019 And I wanted\nto run and warn my father, but she said he\u2019d already been warned\u2014by you,\nby Mother, by many people.\u201d\n\u201cTrue enough,\u201d Hawat muttered.\n\u201cThen why\u2019re we going?\u201d Paul demanded.\n\u201cBecause the Emperor ordered it. And because there\u2019s hope in spite of\nwhat that witch-spy said. What else spouted from this ancient fountain of\nwisdom?\u201d\nPaul looked down at his right hand clenched into a fist beneath the table.\nSlowly, he willed the muscles to relax. She put some kind of hold on me, he\nthought. How?\n\u201cShe asked me to tell her what it is to rule,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd I said that one\ncommands. And she said I had some unlearning to do.\u201d\nShe hit a mark there right enough, Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to\ncontinue.\n\u201cShe said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he\nmust lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019d she figure your father attracted men like Duncan and Gurney?\u201d\nHawat asked.\nPaul shrugged. \u201cThen she said a good ruler has to learn his world\u2019s\nlanguage, that it\u2019s different for every world. And I thought she meant they\ndidn\u2019t speak Galach on Arrakis, but she said that wasn\u2019t it at all. She said she\nmeant the language of the rocks and growing things, the language you don\u2019t\nhear just with your ears. And I said that\u2019s what Dr. Yueh calls the Mystery of\nLife.\u201d\nHawat chuckled. \u201cHow\u2019d that sit with her?\u201d\n\u201cI think she got mad. She said the mystery of life isn\u2019t a problem to solve,\nbut a reality to experience. So I quoted the First Law of Mentat at her: \u2018A\nprocess cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with\nthe flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.\u2019 That seemed to satisfy\nher.\u201d\nHe seems to be getting over it, Hawat thought, but that old witch\nfrightened him. Why did she do it?\n\u201cThufir,\u201d Paul said, \u201cwill Arrakis be as bad as she said?\u201d\n\u201cNothing could be that bad,\u201d Hawat said and forced a smile. \u201cTake those\nFremen, for example, the renegade people of the desert. By first-\napproximation analysis, I can tell you there\u2019re many, many more of them\nthan the Imperium suspects. People live there, lad: a great many people,\nand....\u201d Hawat put a sinewy finger beside his eye. \u201c... they hate Harkonnens\nwith a bloody passion. You must not breathe a word of this, lad. I tell you\nonly as your father\u2019s helper.\u201d\n\u201cMy father has told me of Salusa Secundus,\u201d Paul said. \u201cDo you know,\nThufir, it sounds much like Arrakis ... perhaps not quite as bad, but much like\nit.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not really know of Salusa Secundus today,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cOnly\nwhat it was like long ago ... mostly. But what is known\u2014you\u2019re right on that\nscore.\u201d\n\u201cWill the Fremen help us?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility.\u201d Hawat stood up. \u201cI leave today for Arrakis. Meanwhile,\nyou take care of yourself for an old man who\u2019s fond of you, heh? Come\naround here like the good lad and sit facing the door. It\u2019s not that I think\nthere\u2019s any danger in the castle; it\u2019s just a habit I want you to form.\u201d\nPaul got to his feet, moved around the table. \u201cYou\u2019re going today?\u201d\n\u201cToday it is, and you\u2019ll be following tomorrow. Next time we meet it\u2019ll be\non the soil of your new world.\u201d He gripped Paul\u2019s right arm at the bicep.\n\u201cKeep your knife arm free, heh? And your shield at full charge.\u201d He released\nthe arm, patted Paul\u2019s shoulder, whirled and strode quickly to the door.\n\u201cThufir!\u201d Paul called.\n"
