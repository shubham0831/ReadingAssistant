    "userPrompt": "\u2014\u201d He broke off as the Duke kicked on the jet brakes. The ship bucked as its\ntail pods whispered to silence. Stub wings elongated, cupped the air. The\ncraft became a full \u2018thopter as the Duke banked it, holding the wings to a\ngentle beat, pointing with his left hand off to the east beyond the factory\ncrawler.\n\u201cIs that wormsign?\u201d\nKynes leaned across the Duke to peer into the distance.\nPaul and Halleck were crowded together, looking in the same direction,\nand Paul noted that their escort, caught by the sudden maneuver, had surged\nahead, but now was curving back. The factory crawler lay ahead of them, still\nsome three kilometers away.\nWhere the Duke pointed, crescent dune tracks spread shadow ripples\ntoward the horizon and, running through them as a level line stretching into\nthe distance, came an elongated mount-in-motion\u2014a cresting of sand. It\nreminded Paul of the way a big fish disturbed the water when swimming just\nunder the surface.\n\u201cWorm,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cBig one.\u201d He leaned back, grabbed the microphone\nfrom the panel, punched out a new frequency selection. Glancing at the grid\nchart on rollers over their heads, he spoke into the microphone: \u201cCalling\ncrawler at Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Crawler at Delta Ajax niner.\nWormsign warning. Acknowledge, please.\u201d He waited.\nThe panel speaker emitted static crackles, then a voice: \u201cWho calls Delta\nAjax niner? Over.\u201d\n\u201cThey seem pretty calm about it,\u201d Halleck said.\nKynes spoke into the microphone: \u201cUnlisted flight\u2014north and east of you\nabout three kilometers. Wormsign is on intercept course, your position,\nestimated contact twenty-five minutes.\u201d\nAnother voice rumbled from the speaker: \u201cThis is Spotter Control.\nSighting confirmed. Stand by for contact fix.\u201d There was a pause, then:\n\u201cContact in twenty-six minutes minus. That was a sharp estimate. Who\u2019s on\nthat unlisted flight? Over.\u201d\nHalleck had his harness off and surged forward between Kynes and the\nDuke. \u201cIs this the regular working frequency, Kynes?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Why?\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019d be listening?\u201d\n\u201cJust the work crews in this area. Cuts down interference.\u201d\nAgain, the speaker crackled, then: \u201cThis is Delta Ajax niner. Who gets\nbonus credit for that spot? Over.\u201d\nHalleck glanced at the Duke.\nKynes said: \u201cThere\u2019s a bonus based on spice load for whoever gives first\nworm warning. They want to know\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTell them who had first sight of that worm,\u201d Halleck said.\nThe Duke nodded.\nKynes hesitated, then lifted the microphone: \u201cSpotter credit to the Duke\nLeto Atreides. The Duke Leto Atreides. Over.\u201d\nThe voice from the speaker was flat and partly distorted by a burst of\nstatic: \u201cWe read and thank you.\u201d\n\u201cNow, tell them to divide the bonus among themselves,\u201d Halleck ordered.\n\u201cTell them it\u2019s the Duke\u2019s wish.\u201d\nKynes took a deep breath, then: \u201cIt\u2019s the Duke\u2019s wish that you divide the\nbonus among your crew. Do you read? Over.\u201d\n\u201cAcknowledged and thank you,\u201d the speaker said.\nThe Duke said: \u201cI forgot to mention that Gurney is also very talented in\npublic relations.\u201d\nKynes turned a puzzled frown on Halleck.\n\u201cThis lets the men know their Duke is concerned for their safety,\u201d Halleck\nsaid. \u201cWord will get around. It was on an area working frequency\u2014not likely\nHarkonnen agents heard.\u201d He glanced out at their air cover. \u201cAnd we\u2019re a\npretty strong force. It was a good risk.\u201d\nThe Duke banked their craft toward the sandcloud erupting from the\nfactory crawler. \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a carryall wing somewhere close,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cIt\u2019ll come in and\nlift off the crawler.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if the carryall\u2019s wrecked?\u201d Halleck asked.\n\u201cSome equipment is lost,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cGet in close over the crawler, my\nLord; you\u2019ll find this interesting.\u201d\nThe Duke scowled, busied himself with the controls as they came into\nturbulent air over the crawler.\nPaul looked down, saw sand still spewing out of the metal and plastic\nmonster beneath them. It looked like a great tan and blue beetle with many\nwide tracks extending on arms around it. He saw a giant inverted funnel\nsnout poked into dark sand in front of it.\n\u201cRich spice bed by the color,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cThey\u2019ll continue working until\nthe last minute.\u201d\nThe Duke fed more power to the wings, stiffened them for a steeper\ndescent as he settled lower in a circling glide above the crawler. A glance left\nand right showed his cover holding altitude and circling overhead.\nPaul studied the yellow cloud belching from the crawler\u2019s pipe vents,\nlooked out over the desert at the approaching worm track.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be hearing them call in the carryall?\u201d Halleck asked.\n\u201cThey usually have the wing on a different frequency,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t they have two carryalls standing by for every crawler?\u201d the\nDuke asked. \u201cThere should be twenty-six men on that machine down there,\nnot to mention cost of equipment.\u201d\nKynes said: \u201cYou don\u2019t have enough ex\u2014\u201d\nHe broke off as the speaker erupted with an angry voice: \u201cAny of you see\nthe wing? He isn\u2019t answering.\u201d\nA garble of noise crackled from the speaker, drowned in an abrupt override\nsignal, then silence and the first voice: \u201cReport by the numbers! Over.\u201d\n\u201cThis is Spotter Control. Last I saw, the wing was pretty high and circling\noff northwest. I don\u2019t see him now. Over.\u201d\n\u201cSpotter one: negative. Over.\u201d\n\u201cSpotter two: negative. Over.\u201d\n\u201cSpotter three: negative. Over.\u201d\nSilence.\nThe Duke looked down. His own craft\u2019s shadow was just passing over the\ncrawler. \u201cOnly four spotters, is that right?\u201d\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cThere are five in our party,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cOur ships are larger. We can\ncrowd in three extra each. Their spotters ought to be able to lift off two each.\u201d\nPaul did the mental arithmetic, said: \u201cThat\u2019s three short.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they have two carryalls to each crawler?\u201d barked the Duke.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have enough extra equipment,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cAll the more reason we should protect what we have!\u201d\n\u201cWhere could that carryall go?\u201d Halleck asked.\n\u201cCould\u2019ve been forced down somewhere out of sight,\u201d Kynes said.\nThe Duke grabbed the microphone, hesitated with thumb poised over its\nswitch. \u201cHow could they lose sight of a carryall?\u201d\n\u201cThey keep their attention on the ground looking for wormsign,\u201d Kynes\nsaid.\nThe Duke thumbed the switch, spoke into the microphone. \u201cThis is your\nDuke. We are coming down to take off Delta Ajax niner\u2019s crew. All spotters\nare ordered to comply. Spotters will land on the east side. We will take the\nwest. Over.\u201d He reached down, punched out his own command frequency,\nrepeated the order for his own air cover, handed the microphone back to\nKynes.\nKynes returned to the working frequency and a voice blasted from the\nspeaker: \u201c... almost a full load of spice! We have almost a full load! We can\u2019t\nleave that for a damned worm! Over.\u201d\n\u201cDamn the spice!\u201d the Duke barked. He grabbed back the microphone,\nsaid: \u201cWe can always get more spice. There are seats in our ships for all but\nthree of you. Draw straws or decide any way you like who\u2019s to go. But you\u2019re\ngoing, and that\u2019s an order!\u201d He slammed the microphone back into Kynes\u2019\nhands, muttered: \u201cSorry,\u201d as Kynes shook an injured finger.\n\u201cHow much time?\u201d Paul asked.\n\u201cNine minutes,\u201d Kynes said.\nThe Duke said: \u201cThis ship has more power than the others. If we took off\nunder jet with three-quarter wings, we could crowd in an additional man.\u201d\n\u201cThat sand\u2019s soft,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cWith four extra men aboard on a jet takeoff, we could snap the wings,\nSire,\u201d Halleck said.\n\u201cNot on this ship,\u201d the Duke said. He hauled back on the controls as the\n\u2019thopter glided in beside the crawler. The wings tipped up, braked the\n\u2019thopter to a skidding stop within twenty meters of the factory.\nThe crawler was silent now, no sand spouting from its vents. Only a faint\nmechanical rumble issued from it, becoming more audible as the Duke\nopened his door.\nImmediately, their nostrils were assailed by the odor of cinnamon\u2014heavy\nand pungent.\nWith a loud flapping, the spotter aircraft glided down to the sand on the\nother side of the crawler. The Duke\u2019s own escort swooped in to land in line\nwith him.\nPaul, looking out at the factory, saw how all the \u2019thopters were dwarfed by\nit\u2014gnats beside a warrior beetle.\n\u201cGurney, you and Paul toss out that rear seat,\u201d the Duke said. He manually\ncranked the wings out to three-quarters, set their angle, checked the jet pod\ncontrols. \u201cWhy the devil aren\u2019t they coming out of that machine?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re hoping the carryall will show up,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cThey still have a\nfew minutes.\u201d He glanced off to the east.\nAll turned to look the same direction, seeing no sign of the worm, but there\nwas a heavy, charged feeling of anxiety in the air.\nThe Duke took the microphone, punched for his command frequency, said:\n\u201cTwo of you toss out your shield generators. By the numbers. You can carry\none more man that way. We\u2019re not leaving any men for that monster.\u201d He\nkeyed back to the working frequency, barked:\n\u201cAll right, you in Delta Ajax niner! Out! Now! This is a command from\nyour Duke! On the double or I\u2019ll cut that crawler apart with a lasgun!\u201d\nA hatch snapped open near the front of the factory, another at the rear,\nanother at the top. Men came tumbling out, sliding and scrambling down to\nthe sand. A tall man in a patched working robe was the last to emerge. He\njumped down to a track and then to the sand.\nThe Duke hung the microphone on the panel, swung out onto the wing\nstep, shouted: \u201cTwo men each into your spotters.\u201d\nThe man in the patched robe began tolling off pairs of his crew, pushing\nthem toward the craft waiting on the other side.\n\u201cFour over here!\u201d the Duke shouted. \u201cFour into that ship back there!\u201d He\njabbed a finger at an escort \u2019thopter directly behind him. The guards were just\nwrestling the shield generator out of it. \u201cAnd four into that ship over there!\u201d\nHe pointed to the other escort that had shed its shield generator. \u201cThree each\ninto the others! Run, you sand dogs!\u201d\nThe tall man finished counting off his crew, came slogging across the sand\nfollowed by three of his companions.\n\u201cI hear the worm, but I can\u2019t see it,\u201d Kynes said.\nThe others heard it then\u2014an abrasive slithering, distant and growing\nlouder.\n\u201cDamn sloppy way to operate,\u201d the Duke muttered.\nAircraft began flapping off the sand around them. It reminded the Duke of\na time in his home planet\u2019s jungles, a sudden emergence into a clearing, and\ncarrion birds lifting away from the carcass of a wild ox.\nThe spice workers slogged up to the side of the \u2019thopter, started climbing\nin behind the Duke. Halleck helped, dragging them into the rear.\n\u201cIn you go, boys!\u201d he snapped. \u201cOn the double!\u201d\nPaul, crowded into a corner by sweating men, smelled the perspiration of\nfear, saw that two of the men had poor neck adjustments on their stillsuits. He\nfiled the information in his memory for future action. His father would have\nto order tighter stillsuit discipline. Men tended to become sloppy if you didn\u2019t\nwatch such things.\nThe last man came gasping into the rear, said, \u201cThe worm! It\u2019s almost on\nus! Blast off!\u201d\nThe Duke slid into his seat, frowning, said: \u201cWe still have almost three\nminutes on the original contact estimate. Is that right, Kynes?\u201d He shut his\ndoor, checked it.\n\u201cAlmost exactly, my Lord,\u201d Kynes said, and he thought: A cool one, this\nduke.\n\u201cAll secure here, Sire,\u201d Halleck said.\nThe Duke nodded, watched the last of his escort take off. He adjusted the\nigniter, glanced once more at wings and instruments, punched the jet\nsequence.\nThe take-off pressed the Duke and Kynes deep into their seats, compressed\nthe people in the rear. Kynes watched the way the Duke handled the controls\n\u2014gently, surely. The \u2019thopter was fully airborne now, and the Duke studied\nhis instruments, glanced left and right at his wings.\n\u201cShe\u2019s very heavy, Sire,\u201d Halleck said.\n\u201cWell within the tolerances of this ship,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really\nthink I\u2019d risk this cargo, did you, Gurney?\u201d\nHalleck grinned, said: \u201cNot a bit of it, Sire.\u201d\nThe Duke banked his craft in a long easy curve\u2014climbing over the\ncrawler.\nPaul, crushed into a corner beside a window, stared down at the silent\nmachine on the sand. The wormsign had broken off about four hundred\nmeters from the crawler. And now, there appeared to be turbulence in the\nsand around the factory.\n\u201cThe worm is now beneath the crawler,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cYou are about to\nwitness a thing few have seen.\u201d\nFlecks of dust shadowed the sand around the crawler now. The big\nmachine began to tip down to the right. A gigantic sand whirlpool began\nforming there to the right of the crawler. It moved faster and faster. Sand and\ndust filled the air now for hundreds of meters around.\nThen they saw it!\nA wide hole emerged from the sand. Sunlight flashed from glistening\nwhite spokes within it. The hole\u2019s diameter was at least twice the length of\nthe crawler, Paul estimated. He watched as the machine slid into that opening\nin a billow of dust and sand. The hole pulled back.\n\u201cGods, what a monster!\u201d muttered a man beside Paul.\n\u201cGot all our floggin\u2019 spice!\u201d growled another.\n\u201cSomeone is going to pay for this,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cI promise you that.\u201d\nBy the very flatness of his father\u2019s voice, Paul sensed the deep anger. He\nfound that he shared it. This was criminal waste!\nIn the silence that followed, they heard Kynes.\n\u201cBless the Maker and His water,\u201d Kynes murmured. \u201cBless the coming and\ngoing of Him. May His passage cleanse the world. May He keep the world\nfor His people.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019re saying?\u201d the Duke asked.\nBut Kynes remained silent.\nPaul glanced at the men crowded around him. They were staring fearfully\nat the back of Kynes\u2019 head. One of them whispered: \u201cLiet.\u201d\nKynes turned, scowling. The man sank back, abashed.\nAnother of the rescued men began coughing\u2014dry and rasping. Presently,\nhe gasped: \u201cCurse this hell hole!\u201d\nThe tall Dune man who had come last out of the crawler said: \u201cBe you\nstill, Coss. You but worsen your cough.\u201d He stirred among the men until he\ncould look through them at the back of the Duke\u2019s head. \u201cYou be the Duke\nLeto, I warrant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s to you we give thanks for our lives. We were\nready to end it there until you came along.\u201d\n\u201cQuiet, man, and let the Duke fly his ship,\u201d Halleck muttered.\nPaul glanced at Halleck. He, too, had seen the tension wrinkles at the\ncorner of his father\u2019s jaw. One walked softly when the Duke was in a rage.\nLeto began easing his \u2019thopter out of its great banking circle, stopped at a\nnew sign of movement on the sand. The worm had withdrawn into the depths\nand now, near where the crawler had been, two figures could be seen moving\nnorth away from the sand depression. They appeared to glide over the surface\nwith hardly a lifting of dust to mark their passage.\n\u201cWho\u2019s that down there?\u201d the Duke barked.\n\u201cTwo Johnnies who came along for the ride, Scor,\u201d said the tall Dune man.\n\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t something said about them?\u201d\n\u201cIt was the chance they took, Soor,\u201d the Dune man said.\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d said Kynes, \u201cthese men know it\u2019s of little use to do anything\nabout men trapped on the desert in worm country.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send a ship from base for them!\u201d the Duke snapped.\n\u201cAs you wish, my Lord,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cBut likely when the ship gets here\nthere\u2019ll be no one to rescue.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send a ship, anyway,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cThey were right beside where the worm came up,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHow\u2019d\nthey escape?\u201d\n\u201cThe sides of the hole cave in and make the distances deceptive,\u201d Kynes\nsaid.\n\u201cYou waste fuel here, Sire,\u201d Halleck ventured.\n\u201cAye, Gurney.\u201d\nThe Duke brought his craft around toward the Shield Wall. His escort\ncame down from circling stations, took up positions above and on both sides.\nPaul thought about what the Dune man and Kynes had said. He sensed\nhalf-truths, outright lies. The men on the sand had glided across the surface\nso surely, moving in a way obviously calculated to keep from luring the\nworm back out of its depths.\nFremen! Paul thought. Who else would be so sure on the sand? Who else\nmight be left out of your worries as a matter of course\u2014because they are in\nno danger? They know how to live here! They know how to outwit the worm!\n\u201cWhat were Fremen doing on that crawler?\u201d Paul asked.\nKynes whirled.\nThe tall Dune man turned wide eyes on Paul\u2014blue within blue within\nblue. \u201cWho be this lad?\u201d he asked.\nHalleck moved to place himself between the man and Paul, said: \u201cThis is\nPaul Atreides, the ducal heir.\u201d\n\u201cWhy says he there were Fremen on our rumbler?\u201d the man asked.\n\u201cThey fit the description,\u201d Paul said.\nKynes snorted. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell Fremen just by looking at them!\u201d He looked\nat the Dune man. \u201cYou. Who were those men?\u201d\n\u201cFriends of one of the others,\u201d the Dune man said. \u201cJust friends from a\nvillage who wanted to see the spice sands.\u201d\nKynes turned away. \u201cFremen!\u201d\nBut he was remembering the words of the legend: \u201cTheLisan al-Gaib shall\nsee through all subterfuge. \u201d\n\u201cThey be dead now, most likely, young Soor,\u201d the Dune man said. \u201cWe\nshould not speak unkindly on them.\u201d\nBut Paul heard the falsehood in their voices, felt the menace that had\nbrought Halleck instinctively into guarding position.\nPaul spoke dryly: \u201cA terrible place for them to die.\u201d\nWithout turning, Kynes said: \u201cWhen God hath ordained a creature to die in\na particular place, He causeth that creature\u2019s wants to direct him to that\nplace.\u201d\nLeto turned a hard stare at Kynes.\nAnd Kynes, returning the stare, found himself troubled by a fact he had\nobserved here: This Duke was concerned more over the men than he was over\nthe spice. He risked his own life and that of his son to save the men. He\npassed off the loss of a spice crawler with a gesture. The threat to men\u2019s lives\nhad him in a rage. A leader such as that would command fanatic loyalty. He\nwould be difficult to defeat.\nAgainst his own will and all previous judgments, Kynes admitted to\nhimself: I like this Duke.\nGreatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent.\nIt depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of\nhumankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a\nfeeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected\nupon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic.\nThis is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions.\nThe sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself.\nWithout this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a\nman.\n\u2014from \u201cCollected Sayings of Muad\u2019Dib\u201d by the Princess Irulan\nIN THE dining hall of the Arrakeen great house, suspensor lamps had been\nlighted against the early dark. They cast their yellow glows upward onto the\nblack bull\u2019s head with its bloody horns, and onto the darkly glistening oil\npainting of the Old Duke.\nBeneath these talismans, white linen shone around the burnished\nreflections of the Atreides silver, which had been placed in precise\narrangements along the great table\u2014little archipelagos of service waiting\nbeside crystal glasses, each setting squared off before a heavy wooden chair.\nThe classic central chandelier remained unlighted, and its chain twisted\nupward into shadows where the mechanism of the poison-snooper had been\nconcealed.\nPausing in the doorway to inspect the arrangements, the Duke thought\nabout the poison-snooper and what it signified in his society.\nAll of a pattern, he thought. You can plumb us by our language-the precise\nand delicate delineations for ways to administer treacherous death. Will\nsomeone try chaumurky tonight\u2014poison in the drink? Or will it be chaumas\n\u2014poison in the food?\nHe shook his head.\nBeside each plate on the long table stood a flagon of water. There was\nenough water along the table, the Duke estimated, to keep a poor Arrakeen\nfamily for more than a year.\nFlanking the doorway in which he stood were broad laving basins of ornate\nyellow and green tile. Each basin had its rack of towels. It was the custom,\nthe housekeeper had explained, for guests as they entered to dip their hands\nceremoniously into a basin, slop several cups of water onto the floor, dry\ntheir hands on a towel and fling the towel into the growing puddle at the\ndoor. After the dinner, beggars gathered outside to get the water squeezings\nfrom the towels.\nHow typical of a Harkonnen fief, the Duke thought. Every degradation of\n"
