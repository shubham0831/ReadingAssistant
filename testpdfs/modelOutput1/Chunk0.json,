This every sister of the Bene Gesserit\nknows. To begin your study of the life of Muad\u2018Dib, then, take\ncare that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year\nof the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most\nspecial care that you locate Muad\u2019Dib in his place: the planet\nArrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was bom on\nCaladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the\nplanet known as Dune, is forever his place.\n-from \u201cManual of Muad\u2019Dib\u201d by the Princess Irulan\nIN THE week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final\nscurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to\nvisit the mother of the boy, Paul.\nIt was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that\nhad served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that\ncooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather.\nThe old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by\nPaul\u2019s room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in\nhis bed.\nBy the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor,\nthe awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one\nstep ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow\u2014hair like\nmatted spiderwebs, hooded \u2019round darkness of features, eyes like glittering\njewels.\n\u201cIs he not small for his age, Jessica?\u201d the old woman asked. Her voice\nwheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset.\nPaul\u2019s mother answered in her soft contralto: \u201cThe Atreides are known to\nstart late getting their growth, Your Reverence.\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard, so I\u2019ve heard,\u201d wheezed the old woman. \u201cYet he\u2019s already\nfifteen.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Your Reverence.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s awake and listening to us,\u201d said the old woman. \u201cSly little rascal.\u201d\nShe chuckled. \u201cBut royalty has need of slyness. And if he\u2019s really the\nKwisatz Haderach ... well....\u201d\nWithin the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two\nbird-bright ovals\u2014the eyes of the old woman\u2014seemed to expand and glow\nas they stared into his.\n\u201cSleep well, you sly little rascal,\u201d said the old woman. \u201cTomorrow you\u2019ll\nneed all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.\u201d\nAnd she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid\nthump.\nPaul lay awake wondering: What\u2019s a gom jabbar?\nIn all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest\nthing he had seen.\nYour Reverence.\nAnd the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench\ninstead of what she was\u2014a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke\u2019s concubine and\nmother of the ducal heir.\nIs a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he\nwondered.\nHe mouthed her strange words: Gomjabbar... Kwisatz Haderach.\nThere had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so\ndifferent from Caladan that Paul\u2019s mind whirled with the new knowledge.\nArrakis\u2014Dune\u2014Desert Planet.\nThufir Hawat, his father\u2019s Master of Assassins, had explained it: their\nmortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding\nthe planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the\ngeriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by\nthe House of Atreides in fief-complete-an apparent victory for the Duke Leto.\nYet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the\nDuke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad.\n\u201cA popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,\u201d Hawat had said.\nArrakis\u2014Dune\u2014Desert Planet.\nPaul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around\nhim moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a\ncathedral as he listened to a faint sound\u2014the drip-drip-drip of water. Even\nwhile he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon\nawakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions.\nThe dream faded.\nPaul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed\u2014thinking ... thinking.\nThis world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age,\nperhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted\nthat the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The\nplanet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to\ncommand them: will-o\u2019-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no\ncensus of the Imperial Regate."
