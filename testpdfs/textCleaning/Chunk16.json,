Meanwhile, Lady Jessica detects what she believes was a plot to lure Paul with sex. Leto later leaves the party briefly to deal with a security issue regarding a missing carryall. When he returns, Jessica shares that the carryall was found taken by a Harkonnen agent hoping to sell it to smugglers, but it has been recovered. She also passes along a warning from Leto about potential Harkonnen lasgun shipments.

    "userPrompt": "\u00e2There is no escape\u00e2we pay for the violence of ourancestors.\u00e2\u00e2from \u00e2The Collected Sayings of Muad\u00e2Dib\u00e2 by the Princess IrulanJESSICA HEARD the disturbance in the great hall, turned on the lightbeside her bed. The clock there had not been properly adjusted to local time,and she had to subtract twenty-one minutes to determine that it was about 2A.M.The disturbance was loud and incoherent.Is this the Harkonnen attack? she wondered.She slipped out of bed, checked the screen monitors to see where herfamily was. The screen showed Paul asleep in the deep cellar room they\u00e2dhastily converted to a bedroom for him. The noise obviously wasn\u00e2tpenetrating to his quarters. There was no one in the Duke\u00e2s room, his bed wasunrumpled. Was he still at the field C.P.?There were no screens yet to the front of the house.Jessica stood in the middle of her room, listening.There was one shouting, incoherent voice. She heard someone call for Dr.Yueh. Jessica found a robe, pulled it over her shoulders, pushed her feet intoslippers, strapped the crysknife to her leg.Again, a voice called out for Yueh.Jessica belted the robe around her, stepped into the hallway. Then thethought struck her: What if Leto\u00e2s hurt?The hall seemed to stretch out forever under her running feet. She turnedthrough the arch at the end, dashed past the dining hall and down the passageto the Great Hall, finding the place brightly lighted, all the wall suspensorsglowing at maximum.To her right near the front entry, she saw two house guards holdingDuncan Idaho between them. His head lolled forward, and there was anabrupt, panting silence to the scene.One of the house guards spoke accusingly to Idaho: \u00e2You see what youdid? You woke the Lady Jessica.\u00e2The great draperies billowed behind the men, showing that the front doorremained open. There was no sign of the Duke or Yueh. Mapes stood to oneside staring coldly at Idaho. She wore a long brown robe with serpentinedesign at the hem. Her feet were pushed into unlaced desert boots.\u00e2So I woke the Lady Jessica,\u00e2 Idaho muttered. He lifted his face toward theceiling, bellowed: \u00e2My sword was firs\u00e2 blooded on Grumman!\u00e2Great Mother! He\u00e2s drunk! Jessica thought.Idaho\u00e2s dark, round face was drawn into a frown. His hair, curling like thefur of a black goat, was plastered with dirt. A jagged rent in his tunic exposedan expanse of the dress shirt he had worn at the dinner party earlier.Jessica crossed to him.One of the guards nodded to her without releasing his hold on Idaho. \u00e2Wedidn\u00e2t know what to do with him, my Lady. He was creating a disturbanceout front, refusing to come inside. We were afraid locals might come alongand see him. That wouldn\u00e2t do at all. Give us a bad name here.\u00e2\u00e2Where has he been?\u00e2 Jessica asked.\u00e2He escorted one of the young ladies home from the dinner, my Lady.Hawat\u00e2s orders.\u00e2\u00e2Which young lady?\u00e2\u00e2One of the escort wenches. You understand, my Lady?\u00e2 He glanced atMapes, lowered his voice. \u00e2They\u00e2re always calling on Idaho for specialsurveillance of the ladies.\u00e2And Jessica thought: So they are. But why is he drunk?She frowned, turned to Mapes. \u00e2Mapes, bring a stimulant. I\u00e2d suggestcaffeine. Perhaps there\u00e2s some of the spice coffee left.\u00e2Mapes shrugged, headed for the kitchen. Her unlaced desert boots slap-slapped against the stone floor.Idaho swung his unsteady head around to peer at an angle toward Jessica.\u00e2Killed more\u00e2n three hunner\u00e2 men f\u00e2r the Duke,\u00e2 he muttered. \u00e2Whadduhwanna know is why\u00e2m mere? Can\u00e2t live unner th\u00e2 groun\u00e2 here. Can\u00e2t liveonna groun\u00e2 here. Wha\u00e2 kinna place is \u00e2iss, huh?\u00e2A sound from the side hall entry caught Jessica\u00e2s attention. She turned,saw Yueh crossing to them, his medical kit swinging in his left hand. He wasfully dressed, looked pale, exhausted. The diamond tattoo stood out sharplyon his forehead.\u00e2Th\u00e2 good docker!\u00e2 Idaho shouted. \u00e2Whad\u00e2re you, Doc? Splint \u00e2n\u00e2 pillman?\u00e2 He turned blearily toward Jessica. \u00e2Makin\u00e2 uh damn fool uh m\u00e2self,huh?\u00e2Jessica frowned, remained silent, wondering: Why would Idaho get drunk?Was he drugged?\u00e2Too much spice beer,\u00e2 Idaho said, attempting to straighten.Mapes returned with a steaming cup in her hands, stopped uncertainlybehind Yueh. She looked at Jessica, who shook her head.Yueh put his kit on the floor, nodded greeting to Jessica, said: \u00e2Spice beer,eh?\u00e2\u00e2Bes\u00e2 damn stuff ever tas\u00e2ed,\u00e2 Idaho said. He tried to pull himself toattention. \u00e2My sword was firs\u00e2 blooded on Grumman! Killed a Harkon ...Harkon ... killed \u00e2im f\u00e2r th\u00e2 Duke.\u00e2Yueh turned, looked at the cup in Mapes\u00e2 hand. \u00e2What is that?\u00e2\u00e2Caffeine,\u00e2 Jessica said.Yueh took the cup, held it toward Idaho. \u00e2Drink this, lad.\u00e2 \u00e2Don\u00e2t wan\u00e2any more t\u00e2 drink.\u00e2\u00e2Drink it, I say!\u00e2Idaho\u00e2s head wobbled toward Yueh, and he stumbled one step ahead,dragging the guards with him. \u00e2I\u00e2m almighdy fed up with pleasin\u00e2 th\u00e2\u00e2Mperial Universe, Doc. Jus\u00e2 once, we\u00e2re gonna do th\u00e2 thing my way.\u00e2\u00e2After you drink this,\u00e2 Yueh said. \u00e2It\u00e2s just caffeine.\u00e2\u00e2\u00e2Sprolly like all res\u00e2 uh this place! Damn\u00e2 sun \u00e2stoo brighd. Nothin\u00e2 hasuh righd color. Ever\u00e2thing\u00e2s wrong or....\u00e2\u00e2Well, it\u00e2s nighttime now,\u00e2 Yueh said. He spoke reasonably. \u00e2Drink thislike a good lad. It\u00e2ll make you feel better.\u00e2\u00e2Don\u00e2 wanna feel bedder!\u00e2\u00e2We can\u00e2t argue with him all night,\u00e2 Jessica said. And she thought: Thiscalls for shock treatment.\u00e2There\u00e2s no reason for you to stay, my Lady,\u00e2 Yueh said. \u00e2I can take careof this.\u00e2Jessica shook her head. She stepped forward, slapped Idaho sharply acrossthe cheek.He stumbled back with his guards, glaring at her.\u00e2This is no way to act in your Duke\u00e2s home,\u00e2 she said. She snatched thecup from Yueh\u00e2s hands, spilling part of it, thrust the cup toward Idaho. \u00e2Nowdrink this! That\u00e2s an order!\u00e2Idaho jerked himself upright, scowling down at her. He spoke slowly, withcareful and precise enunciation: \u00e2I do not take orders from a damn\u00e2Harkonnen spy.\u00e2Yueh stiffened, whirled to face Jessica.Her face had gone pale, but she was nodding. It all became clear to her\u00e2the broken stems of meaning she had seen in words and actions around herthese past few days could now be translated. She found herself in the grip ofanger almost too great to contain. It took the most profound of her BeneGesserit training to quiet her pulse and smooth her breathing. Even then shecould feel the blaze flickering.They were always calling on Idaho for surveillance of the ladies!She shot a glance at Yueh. The doctor lowered his eyes.\u00e2You knew this?\u00e2 she demanded.\u00e2I ... heard rumors, my Lady. But I didn\u00e2t want to add to your burdens.\u00e2\u00e2Hawat!\u00e2 she snapped. \u00e2I want Thufir Hawat brought to me immediately!\u00e2\u00e2But, my Lady....\u00e2\u00e2Immediately!\u00e2It has to be Hawat, she thought. Suspicion such as this could come from noother source without being discarded immediately.Idaho shook his head, mumbled. \u00e2Chuck th\u00e2 whole damn thing.\u00e2 Jessicalooked down at the cup in her hand, abruptly dashed its contents acrossIdaho\u00e2s face. \u00e2Lock him in one of the guest rooms of the east wing,\u00e2 sheordered. \u00e2Let him sleep it off.\u00e2The two guards stared at her unhappily. One ventured: \u00e2Perhaps we shouldtake him someplace else, m\u00e2Lady. We could....\u00e2\u00e2He\u00e2s supposed to be here!\u00e2 Jessica snapped. \u00e2He has a job to do here.\u00e2Her voice dripped bitterness. \u00e2He\u00e2s so good at watching the ladies.\u00e2The guard swallowed.\u00e2Do you know where the Duke is?\u00e2 she demanded.\u00e2He\u00e2s at the command post, my Lady.\u00e2\u00e2Is Hawat with him?\u00e2\u00e2Hawat\u00e2s in the city, my Lady.\u00e2\u00e2You will bring Hawat to me at once,\u00e2 Jessica said. \u00e2I will be in my sittingroom when he arrives.\u00e2\u00e2But, my Lady....\u00e2\u00e2If necessary, I will call the Duke,\u00e2 she said. \u00e2I hope it will not benecessary. I would not want to disturb him with this.\u00e2\u00e2Yes, my Lady.\u00e2Jessica thrust the empty cup into Mapes\u00e2 hands, met the questioning stareof the blue-within-blue eyes. \u00e2You may return to bed, Mapes.\u00e2\u00e2You\u00e2re sure you\u00e2ll not need me?\u00e2Jessica smiled grimly. \u00e2I\u00e2m sure.\u00e2\u00e2Perhaps this could wait until tomorrow,\u00e2 Yueh said. \u00e2I could give you asedative and....\u00e2\u00e2You will return to your quarters and leave me to handle this my way,\u00e2 shesaid. She patted his arm to take the sting out of her command. \u00e2This is theonly way.\u00e2Abruptly, head high, she turned and stalked off through the house to herrooms. Cold walls... passages... a familiar door.... She jerked the door open,strode in, and slammed it behind her. Jessica stood there glaring at the shield-blanked windows of her sitting room. Hawat! Could he be the one theHarkonnens bought? We shall see.Jessica crossed to the deep, old-fashioned armchair with an embroideredcover of schlag skin, moved the chair into position to command the door. Shewas suddenly very conscious of the crysknife in its sheath on her leg. Sheremoved the sheath and strapped it to her arm, tested the drop of it. Oncemore, she glanced around the room, placing everything precisely in her mindagainst any emergency: the chaise near the corner, the straight chairs alongthe wall, the two low tables, her stand-mounted zither beside the door to herbedroom.Pale rose light glowed from the suspensor lamps. She dimmed them, satdown in the armchair, patting the upholstery, appreciating the chair\u00e2s regalheaviness for this occasion.Now, let him come, she thought. We shall see what we shall see. And sheprepared herself in the Bene Gesserit fashion for the wait, accumulatingpatience, saving her strength.Sooner than she had expected, a rap sounded at the door and Hawatentered at her command.She watched him without moving from the chair, seeing the cracklingsense of drug-induced energy in his movements, seeing the fatigue beneath.Hawat\u00e2s rheumy old eyes glittered. His leathery skin appeared faintly yellowin the room\u00e2s light, and there was a wide, wet stain on the sleeve of his knifearm.She smelled blood there.Jessica gestured to one of the straight-backed chairs, said: \u00e2Bring that chairand sit facing me.\u00e2Hawat bowed, obeyed. That drunken fool of an Idaho! he thought. Hestudied Jessica\u00e2s face, wondering how he could save this situation.\u00e2It\u00e2s long past time to clear the air between us,\u00e2 Jessica said.\u00e2What troubles my Lady?\u00e2 He sat down, placed hands on knees.\u00e2Don\u00e2t play coy with me!\u00e2 she snapped. \u00e2If Yueh didn\u00e2t tell you why Isummoned you, then one of your spies in my household did. Shall we be atleast that honest with each other?\u00e2\u00e2As you wish, my Lady.\u00e2\u00e2First, you will answer me one question,\u00e2 she said. \u00e2Are you now aHarkonnen agent?\u00e2Hawat surged half out of his chair, his face dark with fury, demanding:\u00e2You dare insult me so?\u00e2\u00e2Sit down,\u00e2 she said. \u00e2You insulted me so.\u00e2Slowly, he sank back into the chair.And Jessica, reading the signs of this face that she knew so well, allowedherself a deep breath. It isn\u00e2t Hawat.\u00e2Now I know you remain loyal to my Duke,\u00e2 she said. \u00e2I\u00e2m prepared,therefore, to forgive your affront to me.\u00e2\u00e2Is there something to forgive?\u00e2Jessica scowled, wondering: Shall I play my trump? Shall I tell him of theDuke\u00e2s daughter I\u00e2ve carried within me these few weeks? No... Leto himselfdoesn\u00e2t know. This would only complicate his life, divert him in a time whenhe must concentrate on our survival. There is yet time to use this.\u00e2A Truthsayer would solve this,\u00e2 she said, \u00e2but we have no Truthsayerqualified by the High Board.\u00e2\u00e2As you say. We\u00e2ve no Truthsayer.\u00e2\u00e2Is there a traitor among us?\u00e2 she asked. \u00e2I\u00e2ve studied our people withgreat care. Who could it be? Not Gurney. Certainly not Duncan. Theirlieutenants are not strategically enough placed to consider. It\u00e2s not you,Thufir. It cannot be Paul. I know it\u00e2s not me. Dr. Yueh, then? Shall I call himin and put him to the test?\u00e2\u00e2You know that\u00e2s an empty gesture,\u00e2 Hawat said. \u00e2He\u00e2s conditioned by theHigh College. That I know for certain.\u00e2\u00e2Not to mention that his wife was a Bene Gesserit slain by theHarkonnens,\u00e2 Jessica said.\u00e2So that\u00e2s what happened to her,\u00e2 Hawat said.\u00e2Haven\u00e2t you heard the hate in his voice when he speaks the Harkonnenname?\u00e2\u00e2You know I don\u00e2t have the ear,\u00e2 Hawat said.\u00e2What brought this base suspicion on me?\u00e2 she asked.Hawat frowned. \u00e2My Lady puts her servant in an impossible position. Myfirst loyalty is to the Duke.\u00e2\u00e2I\u00e2m prepared to forgive much because of that loyalty,\u00e2 she said.\u00e2And again I must ask: Is there something to forgive?\u00e2\u00e2Stalemate?\u00e2 she asked.He shrugged.\u00e2Let us discuss something else for a minute, then,\u00e2 she said. \u00e2DuncanIdaho, the admirable fighting man whose abilities at guarding andsurveillance are so esteemed. Tonight, he overindulged in something calledspice beer. I hear reports that others among our people have been stupefiedby this concoction. Is that true?\u00e2\u00e2You have your reports, my Lady.\u00e2\u00e2So I do. Don\u00e2t you see this drinking as a symptom, Thufir?\u00e2\u00e2My Lady speaks riddles.\u00e2\u00e2Apply your Mentat abilities to it!\u00e2 she snapped. \u00e2What\u00e2s the problem withDuncan and the others? I can tell you in four words\u00e2they have no home.\u00e2He jabbed a finger at the floor. \u00e2Arrakis, that\u00e2s their home.\u00e2\u00e2Arrakis is an unknown! Caladan was their home, but we\u00e2ve uprootedthem. They have no home. And they fear the Duke\u00e2s failing them.\u00e2He stiffened. \u00e2Such talk from one of the men would be cause for\u00e2\u00e2\u00e2Oh, stop that, Thufir. Is it defeatist or treacherous for a doctor to diagnosea disease correctly? My only intention is to cure the disease.\u00e2\u00e2The Duke gives me charge over such matters.\u00e2\u00e2But you understand I have a certain natural concern over the progress ofthis disease,\u00e2 she said. \u00e2And perhaps you\u00e2ll grant I have certain abilitiesalong these lines.\u00e2Will I have to shock him sererely? she wondered. He needs shaking up\u00e2something to break him from routine.\u00e2There could be many interpretations for your concern,\u00e2 Hawat said. Heshrugged.\u00e2Then you\u00e2ve already convicted me?\u00e2\u00e2Of course not, my Lady. But I cannot afford to take any chances, thesituation being what it is.\u00e2\u00e2A threat to my son got past you right here in this house,\u00e2 she said. \u00e2Whotook that chance?\u00e2His face darkened. \u00e2I offered my resignation to the Duke.\u00e2\u00e2Did you offer your resignation to me... or to Paul?\u00e2Now he was openly angry, betraying it in quickness of breathing, indilation of nostrils, a steady stare. She saw a pulse beating at his temple.\u00e2I\u00e2m the Duke\u00e2s man,\u00e2 he said, biting off the words.\u00e2There is no traitor,\u00e2 she said. \u00e2The threat\u00e2s something else. Perhaps it hasto do with the lasguns. Perhaps they\u00e2ll risk secreting a few lasguns withtiming mechanisms aimed at house shields. Perhaps they\u00e2ll....\u00e2\u00e2And who could tell after the blast if the explosion wasn\u00e2t atomic?\u00e2 heasked. \u00e2No, my Lady. They\u00e2ll not risk anything that illegal. Radiation lingers.The evidence is hard to erase. No. They\u00e2ll observe most of the forms. It has tobe a traitor.\u00e2\u00e2You\u00e2re the Duke\u00e2s man,\u00e2 she sneered. \u00e2Would you destroy him in theeffort to save him?\u00e2He took a deep breath, then: \u00e2If you\u00e2re innocent, you\u00e2ll have my mostabject apologies.\u00e2\u00e2Look at you now, Thufir,\u00e2 she said. \u00e2Humans live best when each has hisown place, when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things.Destroy the place and destroy the person. You and I, Thufir, of all those wholove the Duke, are most ideally situated to destroy the other\u00e2s place. Could Inot whisper suspicions about you into the Duke\u00e2s ear at night? When wouldhe be most susceptible to such whispering, Thufir? Must I draw it for youmore clearly?\u00e2\u00e2You threaten me?\u00e2 he growled.\u00e2Indeed not. I merely point out to you that someone is attacking us throughthe basic arrangement of our lives. It\u00e2s clever, diabolical. I propose to negatethis attack by so ordering our lives that there\u00e2ll be no chinks for such barbs toenter.\u00e2\u00e2You accuse me of whispering baseless suspicions?\u00e2\u00e2Baseless, yes.\u00e2\u00e2You\u00e2d meet this with your own whispers?\u00e2\u00e2Your life is compounded of whispers, not mine, Thufir.\u00e2\u00e2Then you question my abilities?\u00e2She sighed. \u00e2Thufir, I want you to examine your own emotionalinvolvement in this. The natural human\u00e2s an animal without logic. Yourprojections of logic onto all affairs is unnatural, but suffered to continue forits usefulness. You\u00e2re the embodiment of logic\u00e2a Mentat. Yet, your problemsolutions are concepts that, in a very real sense, are projected outsideyourself, there to be studied and rolled around, examined from all sides.\u00e2\u00e2You think now to teach me my trade?\u00e2 he asked, and he did not try tohide the disdain in his voice.\u00e2Anything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your logic to it,\u00e2she said. \u00e2But it\u00e2s a human trait that when we encounter personal problems,those things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for ourlogic to scan. We tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual,deep-seated thing that\u00e2s really chewing on us.\u00e2\u00e2You\u00e2re deliberately attempting to undermine my faith in my abilities as aMentat,\u00e2 he rasped. \u00e2Were I to find one of our people attempting thus tosabotage any other weapon in our arsenal, I should not hesitate to denounceand destroy him.\u00e2\u00e2The finest Mentats have a healthy respect for the error factor in theircomputations,\u00e2 she said.\u00e2I\u00e2ve never said otherwise!\u00e2\u00e2Then apply yourself to these symptoms we\u00e2ve both seen: drunkennessamong the men, quarrels\u00e2they gossip and exchange wild rumors aboutArrakis; they ignore the most simple\u00e2\u00e2\u00e2Idleness, no more,\u00e2 he said. \u00e2Don\u00e2t try to divert my attention by trying tomake a simple matter appear mysterious.\u00e2She stared at him, thinking of the Duke\u00e2s men rubbing their woes togetherin the barracks until you could almost smell the charge there, like burntinsulation. They\u00e2re becoming like the men of the pre-Guild legend, shethought: Like the men of the lost star-searcher, Ampoliros-sick at their guns\u00e2foreverseeking, forever prepared and forever unready.\u00e2Why have you never made full use of my abilities in your service to theDuke?\u00e2 she asked. \u00e2Do you fear a rival for your position?\u00e2He glared at her, the old eyes blazing. \u00e2I know some of the training theygive you Bene Gesserit....\u00e2 He broke off, scowling.\u00e2Go ahead, say it,\u00e2 she said. \u00e2Bene Gesserit witches.\u00e2\u00e2I know something of the real training they give you,\u00e2 he said. \u00e2I\u00e2ve seenit come out in Paul. I\u00e2m not fooled by what your schools tell the public: youexist only to serve.\u00e2The shock must be severe and he\u00e2s almost ready for it, she thought.\u00e2You listen respectfully to me in Council,\u00e2 she said, \u00e2yet you seldom heedmy advice. Why?\u00e2\u00e2I don\u00e2t trust your Bene Gesserit motives,\u00e2 he said. \u00e2You may think youcan look through a man; you may think you can make a man do exactly whatyou\u00e2\u00e2\u00e2You poor fool, Thufir!\u00e2 she raged.He scowled, pushing himself back in the chair.\u00e2Whatever rumors you\u00e2ve heard about our schools,\u00e2 she said, \u00e2the truth isfar greater. If I wished to destroy the Duke... or you, or any other personwithin my reach, you could not stop me.\u00e2And she thought: Why do I let pride drive such words out of me? This isnot the way I was trained. This is not how I must shock him.Hawat slipped a hand beneath his tunic where he kept a tiny projector ofpoison darts. She wears no shield, he thought. Is this just a brag she makes? Icould slay her now... but, ah-h-h-h, the consequences if I\u00e2m wrong.Jessica saw the gesture toward his pocket, said: \u00e2Let us pray violence shallnever be necessary between us.\u00e2\u00e2A worthy prayer,\u00e2 he agreed.\u00e2Meanwhile, the sickness spreads among us,\u00e2 she said. \u00e2I must ask youagain: Isn\u00e2t it more reasonable to suppose the Harkonnens have planted thissuspicion to pit the two of us against each other?\u00e2\u00e2We appear to\u00e2ve returned to stalemate,\u00e2 he said.She sighed, thinking: He\u00e2s almost ready for it.\u00e2The Duke and I are father and mother surrogates to our people,\u00e2 she said.\u00e2The position\u00e2\u00e2\u00e2He hasn\u00e2t married you,\u00e2 Hawat said.She forced herself to calmness, thinking: A good riposte, that.\u00e2But he\u00e2ll not marry anyone else,\u00e2 she said. \u00e2Not as long as I live. And weare surrogates, as I\u00e2ve said. To break up this natural order in our affairs, todisturb, disrupt, and confuse us\u00e2which target offers itself most enticingly tothe Harkonnens?\u00e2He sensed the direction she was taking, and his brows drew down in alowering scowl.\u00e2The Duke?\u00e2 she asked. \u00e2Attractive target, yes, but no one with thepossible exception of Paul is better guarded. Me? I tempt them, surely, butthey must know the Bene Gesserit make difficult targets. And there\u00e2s a bettertarget, one whose duties create, necessarily, a monstrous blind spot. One towhom suspicion is as natural as breathing. One who builds his entire life oninnuendo and mystery.\u00e2 She darted her right hand toward him. \u00e2You!\u00e2Hawat started to leap from his chair.\u00e2I have not dismissed you, Thufir!\u00e2 she flared.The old Mentat almost fell back into the chair, so quickly did his musclesbetray him.She smiled without mirth."
