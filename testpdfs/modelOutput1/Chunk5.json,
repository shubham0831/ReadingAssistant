    "userPrompt": "How do we approach the study of Muad\u2018Dib\u2019s father? A\nman of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the\nDuke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way to this Duke:\nhis abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held\nfor his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see\nhim there\u2014aman snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his\nlight dimmed behind the glory of his son. Still, one must ask:\nWhat is the son but an extension of the father?\n\u2014from\u201cMuad\u2019Dib, Family Commentaries\u201d by the Princess Irulan\nPAUL WATCHED his father enter the training room, saw the guards take\nup stations outside. One of them closed the door. As always, Paul\nexperienced a sense of presence in his father, someone totally here.\nThe Duke was tall, olive-skinned. His thin face held harsh angles warmed\nonly by deep gray eyes. He wore a black working uniform with red armorial\nhawk crest at the breast. A silvered shield belt with the patina of much use\ngirded his narrow waist.\nThe Duke said: \u201cHard at work, Son?\u201d\nHe crossed to the ell table, glanced at the papers on it, swept his gaze\naround the room and back to Paul. He felt tired, filled with the ache of not\nshowing his fatigue. I must use every opportunity to rest during the crossing\nto Arrakis, he thought. There\u2019ll be no rest on Arrakis.\n\u201cNot very hard,\u201d Paul said. \u201cEverything\u2019s so....\u201d He shrugged.\n\u201cYes. Well, tomorrow we leave. It\u2019ll be good to get settled in our new\nhome, put all this upset behind.\u201d\nPaul nodded, suddenly overcome by memory of the Reverend Mother\u2019s\nwords: \u201c...for the father, nothing.\u201d\n\u201cFather,\u201d Paul said, \u201cwill Arrakis be as dangerous as everyone says?\u201d\nThe Duke forced himself to the casual gesture, sat down on a corner of the\ntable, smiled. A whole pattern of conversation welled up in his mind\u2014the\nkind of thing he might use to dispel the vapors in his men before a battle. The\npattern froze before it could be vocalized, confronted by the single thought:\nThis is my son.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be dangerous,\u201d he admitted.\n\u201cHawat tells me we have a plan for the Fremen,\u201d Paul said. And he\nwondered: Why don\u2019t I tell him what that old woman said? How did she seal\nmy tongue?\nThe Duke noted his son\u2019s distress, said: \u201cAs always, Hawat sees the main\nchance. But there\u2019s much more. I see also the Combine Honnete Ober\nAdvancer Mercantiles\u2014the CHOAM Company. By giving me Arrakis, His\nMajesty is forced to give us a CHOAM directorship ... a subtle gain.\u201d\n\u201cCHOAM controls the spice,\u201d Paul said.\n\u201cAnd Arrakis with its spice is our avenue into CHOAM,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more to CHOAM than melange.\u201d\n\u201cDid the Reverend Mother warn you?\u201d Paul blurted. He clenched his fists,\nfeeling his palms slippery with perspiration. The effort it had taken to ask that\nquestion.\n\u201cHawat tells me she frightened you with warnings about Arrakis,\u201d the\nDuke said. \u201cDon\u2019t let a woman\u2019s fears cloud your mind. No woman wants\nher loved ones endangered. The hand behind those warnings was your\nmother\u2019s. Take this as a sign of her love for us.\u201d\n\u201cDoes she know about the Fremen?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and about much more.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnd the Duke thought: The truth could be worse than he imagines, but\neven dangerous facts arevaluable if you\u2019ve been trained to deal with them.\nAnd there\u2019s one place where nothing has been spared for my son\u2014\ndealingwith dangerous facts. This must be leavened, though; he is young.\n\u201cFew products escape the CHOAM touch,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cLogs, donkeys,\nhorses, cows, lumber, dung, sharks, whale fur\u2014the most prosaic and the\nmost exotic ... even our poor pundi rice from Caladan. Anything the Guild\nwill transport, the art forms of Ecaz, the machines of Richesse and Ix. But all\nfades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It\ncannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has\ntrue geriatric properties.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now we control it?\u201d\n\u201cTo a certain degree. But the important thing is to consider all the Houses\nthat depend on CHOAM profits. And think of the enormous proportion of\nthose profits dependent upon a single product\u2014the spice. Imagine what\nwould happen if something should reduce spice production.\u201d\n\u201cWhoever had stockpiled melange could make a killing,\u201d Paul said.\n\u201cOthers would be out in the cold.\u201d\nThe Duke permitted himself a moment of grim satisfaction, looking at his\nson and thinking how penetrating, how truly educated that observation had\nbeen. He nodded. \u201cThe Harkonnens have been stockpiling for more than\ntwenty years.\u201d\n\u201cThey mean spice production to fail and you to be blamed.\u201d\n\u201cThey wish the Atreides name to become unpopular,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cThink of the Landsraad Houses that look to me for a certain amount of\nleadership\u2014their unofficial spokesman. Think how they\u2019d react if I were\nresponsible for a serious reduction in their income. After all, one\u2019s own\nprofits come first. The Great Convention be damned! You can\u2019t let someone\npauperize you!\u201d A harsh smile twisted the Duke\u2019s mouth. \u201cThey\u2019d look the\nother way no matter what was done to me.\u201d\n\u201cEven if we were attacked with atomics?\u201d\n\u201cNothing that flagrant. No open defiance of the Convention. But almost\nanything else short of that ... perhaps even dusting and a bit of soil\npoisoning.\u201d\n\u201cThen why are we walking into this?\u201d\n\u201cPaul!\u201d The Duke frowned at his son. \u201cKnowing where the trap is\u2014that\u2019s\nthe first step in evading it. This is like single combat, Son, only on a larger\nscale\u2014a feint within a feint within a feint ... seemingly without end. The task\nis to unravel it. Knowing that the Harkonnens stockpile melange, we ask\nanother question: Who else is stockpiling? That\u2019s the list of our enemies.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cCertain Houses we knew were unfriendly and some we\u2019d thought\nfriendly. We need not consider them for the moment because there is one\nother much more important: our beloved Padishah Emperor.\u201d\nPaul tried to swallow in a throat suddenly dry. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you convene the\nLandsraad, expose\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMake our enemy aware we know which hand holds the knife? Ah, now,\nPaul\u2014we see the knife, now. Who knows where it might be shifted next? If\nwe put this before the Landsraad it\u2019d only create a great cloud of confusion.\nThe Emperor would deny it. Who could gainsay him? All we\u2019d gain is a little\ntime while risking chaos. And where would the next attack come from?\u201d\n\u201cAll the Houses might start stockpiling spice.\u201d\n\u201cOur enemies have a head start\u2014too much of a lead to overcome.\u201d\n\u201cThe Emperor,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThat means the Sardaukar.\u201d\n\u201cDisguised in Harkonnen livery, no doubt,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cBut the soldier\nfanatics nonetheless.\u201d\n\u201cHow can Fremen help us against Sardaukar?\u201d\n\u201cDid Hawat talk to you about Salusa Secundus?\u201d\n\u201cThe Emperor\u2019s prison planet? No.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if it were more than a prison planet, Paul? There\u2019s a question you\nnever hear asked about the Imperial Corps of Sardaukar: Where do they come\nfrom?\u201d\n\u201cFrom the prison planet?\u201d\n\u201cThey come from somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cBut the supporting levies the Emperor demands from\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re led to believe: they\u2019re just the Emperor\u2019s levies trained\nyoung and superbly. You hear an occasional muttering about the Emperor\u2019s\ntraining cadres, but the balance of our civilization remains the same: the\nmilitary forces of the Landsraad Great Houses on one side, the Sardaukar and\ntheir supporting levies on the other. And their supporting levies, Paul. The\nSardaukar remain the Sardaukar.\u201d\n\u201cBut every report on Salusa Secundus says S.S. is a hell world!\u201d\n\u201cUndoubtedly. But if you were going to raise tough, strong, ferocious men,\nwhat environmental conditions would you impose on them?\u201d\n\u201cHow could you win the loyalty of such men?\u201d\n\u201cThere are proven ways: play on the certain knowledge of their superiority,\nthe mystique of secret covenant, the esprit of shared suffering. It can be done.\nIt has been done on many worlds in many times.\u201d\nPaul nodded, holding his attention on his father\u2019s face. He felt some\nrevelation impending.\n\u201cConsider Arrakis,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cWhen you get outside the towns and\ngarrison villages, it\u2019s every bit as terrible a place as Salusa Secundus.\u201d\nPaul\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cThe Fremen!\u201d\n\u201cWe have there the potential of a corps as strong and deadly as the\nSardaukar. It\u2019ll require patience to exploit them secretly and wealth to equip\nthem properly. But the Fremen are there ... and the spice wealth is there. You\nsee now why we walk into Arrakis, knowing the trap is there.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t the Harkonnens know about the Fremen?\u201d\n\u201cThe Harkonnens sneered at the Fremen, hunted them for sport, never even\nbothered trying to count them. We know the Harkonnen policy with planetary\npopulations\u2014spend as little as possible to maintain them.\u201d\nThe metallic threads in the hawk symbol above his father\u2019s breast glistened\nas the Duke shifted his position. \u201cYou see?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re negotiating with the Fremen right now,\u201d Paul said.\n\u201cI sent a mission headed by Duncan Idaho,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cA proud and\nruthless man, Duncan, but fond of the truth. I think the Fremen will admire\nhim. If we\u2019re lucky, they may judge us by him: Duncan, the moral.\u201d\n\u201cDuncan, the moral,\u201d Paul said, \u201cand Gurney the valorous.\u201d\n\u201cYou name them well,\u201d the Duke said.\nAnd Paul thought: Gurney\u2019s one of those the Reverend Mother meant, a\nsupporter of worlds\u2014\u201c... the valor of the brave. \u201d\n\u201cGurney tells me you did well in weapons today,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t what he told me.\u201d\nThe Duke laughed aloud. \u201cI figured Gurney to be sparse with his praise.\nHe says you have a nicety of awareness\u2014in his own words\u2014of the\ndifference between a blade\u2019s edge and its tip.\u201d\n\u201cGurney says there\u2019s no artistry in killing with the tip, that it should be\ndone with the edge.\u201d\n\u201cGurney\u2019s a romantic,\u201d the Duke growled. This talk of killing suddenly\ndisturbed him, coming from his son. \u201cI\u2019d sooner you never had to kill ... but\nif the need arises, you do it however you can\u2014tip or edge.\u201d He looked up at\nthe skylight, on which the rain was drumming.\nSeeing the direction of his father\u2019s stare, Paul thought of the wet skies out\nthere\u2014a thing never to be seen on Arrakis from all accounts\u2014and this\nthought of skies put him in mind of the space beyond. \u201cAre the Guild ships\nreally big?\u201d he asked.\nThe Duke looked at him. \u201cThis will be your first time off planet,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYes, they\u2019re big. We\u2019ll be riding a Heighliner because it\u2019s a long trip. A\nHeighliner is truly big. Its hold will tuck all our frigates and transports into a\nlittle corner\u2014we\u2019ll be just a small part of the ship\u2019s manifest.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we won\u2019t be able to leave our frigates?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the price you pay for Guild Security. There could be\nHarkonnen ships right alongside us and we\u2019d have nothing to fear from them.\nThe Harkonnens know better than to endanger their shipping privileges.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to watch our screens and try to see a Guildsman.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t. Not even their agents ever see a Guildsman. The Guild\u2019s as\njealous of its privacy as it is of its monopoly. Don\u2019t do anything to endanger\nour shipping privileges, Paul.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think they hide because they\u2019ve mutated and don\u2019t look ... human\nanymore?\u201d\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d The Duke shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery we\u2019re not likely to\nsolve. We\u2019ve more immediate problems\u2014among them: you.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\u201cYour mother wanted me to be the one to tell you, Son. You see, you may\nhave Mentat capabilities.\u201d\nPaul stared at his father, unable to speak for a moment, then: \u201cA Mentat?\nMe? But I....\u201d\n\u201cHawat agrees, Son. It\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cBut I thought Mentat training had to start during infancy and the subject\ncouldn\u2019t be told because it might inhibit the early....\u201d He broke off, all his\npast circumstances coming to focus in one flashing computation. \u201cI see,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\u201cA day comes,\u201d the Duke said, \u201cwhen the potential Mentat must learn\nwhat\u2019s being done. It may no longer be done to him. The Mentat has to share\nin the choice of whether to continue or abandon the training. Some can\ncontinue; some are incapable of it. Only the potential Mentat can tell this for\nsure about himself.\u201d\nPaul rubbed his chin. All the special training from Hawat and his mother\u2014\nthe mnemonics, the focusing of awareness, the muscle control and sharpening\nof sensitivities, the study of languages and nuances of voices\u2014all of it\nclicked into a new kind of understanding in his mind.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be the Duke someday, Son,\u201d his father said. \u201cA Mentat Duke\nwould be formidable indeed. Can you decide now ... or do you need more\ntime?\u201d\nThere was no hesitation in his answer. \u201cI\u2019ll go on with the training.\u201d\n\u201cFormidable indeed,\u201d the Duke murmured, and Paul saw the proud smile\non his father\u2019s face. The smile shocked Paul: it had a skull look on the\nDuke\u2019s narrow features. Paul closed his eyes, feeling the terrible purpose\nreawaken within him. Perhaps being a Mentat is terrible purpose, he\nthought.\nBut even as he focused on this thought, his new awareness denied it.\nWith the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system\nof sowing implant- legends through the Missionaria Protectiva\ncame to its full fruition. The wisdom of seeding the known\nuniverse with a prophecy pattern for the protection of B.G.\npersonnel has long been appreciated, but never have we seen a\ncondition- ut-extremis with more ideal mating of person and\npreparation. The prophetic legends had taken on Arrakis even\nto the extent of adopted labels (including Reverend Mother,\ncanto and respondu, and most of the Shari-a panoplia\npropheticus). And it is generally accepted now that the Lady\nJessica\u2019s latent abilities were grossly underestimated.\n\u2014from \u201cAnalysis: The Arrakeen Crisis\u201d by the Princess Irulan (private circulation: B.G. file\nnumber AR-81088587)\nALL AROUND the Lady Jessica\u2014piled in corners of the Arrakeen great\nhall, mounded in the open spaces\u2014stood the packaged freight of their lives:\nboxes, trunks, cartons, cases\u2014some partly unpacked. She could hear the\ncargo handlers from the Guild shuttle depositing another load in the entry.\nJessica stood in the center of the hall. She moved in a slow turn, looking up\nand around at shadowed carvings, crannies and deeply recessed windows.\nThis giant anachronism of a room reminded her of the Sisters\u2019 Hall at her\nBene Gesserit school. But at the school the effect had been of warmth. Here,\nall was bleak stone.\nSome architect had reached far back into history for these buttressed walls\nand dark hangings, she thought. The arched ceiling stood two stories above\nher with great crossbeams she felt sure had been shipped here to Arrakis\nacross space at monstrous cost. No planet of this system grew trees to make\nsuch beams\u2014unless the beams were imitation wood.\nShe thought not.\nThis had been the government mansion in the days of the Old Empire.\nCosts had been of less importance then. It had been before the Harkonnens\nand their new megalopolis of Carthag\u2014a cheap and brassy place some two\nhundred kilometers northeast across the Broken Land. Leto had been wise to\nchoose this place for his seat of government. The name, Arrakeen, had a good\nsound, filled with tradition. And this was a smaller city, easier to sterilize and\ndefend.\nAgain there came the clatter of boxes being unloaded in the entry. Jessica\nsighed.\nAgainst a carton to her right stood the painting of the Duke\u2019s father.\nWrapping twine hung from it like a frayed decoration. A piece of the twine\nwas still clutched in Jessica\u2019s left hand. Beside the painting lay a black bull\u2019s\nhead mounted on a polished board. The head was a dark island in a sea of\nwadded paper. Its plaque lay flat on the floor, and the bull\u2019s shiny muzzle\npointed at the ceiling as though the beast were ready to bellow a challenge\ninto this echoing room.\nJessica wondered what compulsion had brought her to uncover those two\nthings first\u2014the head and the painting. She knew there was something\nsymbolic in the action. Not since the day when the Duke\u2019s buyers had taken\nher from the school had she felt this frightened and unsure of herself.\nThe head and the picture.\nThey heightened her feelings of confusion. She shuddered, glanced at the\nslit windows high overhead. It was still early afternoon here, and in these\nlatitudes the sky looked black and cold\u2014so much darker than the warm blue\nof Caladan. A pang of homesickness throbbed through her.\nSo far away, Caladan.\n\u201cHere we are!\u201d\nThe voice was Duke Leto\u2019s.\nShe whirled, saw him striding from the arched passage to the dining hall.\nHis black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast looked\ndusty and rumpled.\n\u201cI thought you might have lost yourself in this hideous place,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is a cold house,\u201d she said. She looked at his tallness, at the dark skin\nthat made her think of olive groves and golden sun on blue waters. There was\nwoodsmoke in the gray of his eyes, but the face was predatory: thin, full of\nsharp angles and planes.\nA sudden fear of him tightened her breast. He had become such a savage,\ndriving person since the decision to bow to the Emperor\u2019s command.\n\u201cThe whole city feels cold,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dirty, dusty little garrison town,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut we\u2019ll change that.\u201d\nHe looked around the hall. \u201cThese are public rooms for state occasions. I\u2019ve\njust glanced at some of the family apartments in the south wing. They\u2019re\nmuch nicer.\u201d He stepped closer, touched her arm, admiring her stateliness.\nAnd again, he wondered at her unknown ancestry\u2014a renegade House,\nperhaps? Some black-barred royalty? She looked more regal than the\nEmperor\u2019s own blood.\nUnder the pressure of his stare, she turned half away, exposing her profile.\nAnd he realized there was no single and precise thing that brought her beauty\nto focus. The face was oval under a cap of hair the color of polished bronze.\nHer eyes were set wide, as green and clear as the morning skies of Caladan.\nThe nose was small, the mouth wide and generous. Her figure was good but\nscant: tall and with its curves gone to slimness.\nHe remembered that the lay sisters at the school had called her skinny, so\nhis buyers had told him. But that description oversimplified. She had brought\na regal beauty back into the Atreides line. He was glad that Paul favored her.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Paul?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cSomeplace around the house taking his lessons with Yueh.\u201d\n\u201cProbably in the south wing,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I heard Yueh\u2019s voice, but\nI couldn\u2019t take time to look.\u201d He glanced down at her, hesitating. \u201cI came\nhere only to hang the key of Caladan Castle in the dining hall.\u201d\nShe caught her breath, stopped the impulse to reach out to him. Hanging\nthe key\u2014there was finality in that action. But this was not the time or place\nfor comforting. \u201cI saw our banner over the house as we came in,\u201d she said.\nHe glanced at the painting of his father. \u201cWhere were you going to hang\nthat?\u201d\n\u201cSomewhere in here.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d The word rang flat and final, telling her she could use trickery to\npersuade, but open argument was useless. Still, she had to try, even if the\ngesture served only to remind herself that she would not trick him.\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d she said, \u201cif you\u2019d only....\u201d\n\u201cThe answer remains no. I indulge you shamefully in most things, not in\nthis. I\u2019ve just come from the dining hall where there are\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy Lord! Please.\u201d\n\u201cThe choice is between your digestion and my ancestral dignity, my dear,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThey will hang in the dining hall.\u201d\nShe sighed. \u201cYes, my Lord.\u201d\n\u201cYou may resume your custom of dining in your rooms whenever possible.\nI shall expect you at your proper position only on formal occasions.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, my Lord.\u201d\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t go all cold and formal on me! Be thankful that I never married\nyou, my dear. Then it\u2019d be your duty to join me at table for every meal.\u201d\nShe held her face immobile, nodded.\n\u201cHawat already has our own poison snooper over the dining table,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThere\u2019s a portable in your room.\u201d\n\u201cYou anticipated this ... disagreement,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMy dear, I think also of your comfort. I\u2019ve engaged servants. They\u2019re\nlocals, but Hawat has cleared them\u2014they\u2019re Fremen all. They\u2019ll do until our\nown people can be released from their other duties.\u201d\n\u201cCan anyone from this place be truly safe?\u201d\n\u201cAnyone who hates Harkonnens. You may even want to keep the head\nhousekeeper: the Shadout Mapes.\u201d\n\u201cShadout,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cA Fremen title?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m told it means \u2018well-dipper,\u2019 a meaning with rather important\novertones here. She may not strike you as a servant type, although Hawat\nspeaks highly of her on the basis of Duncan\u2019s report. They\u2019re convinced she\nwants to serve\u2014specifically that she wants to serve you.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\u201cThe Fremen have learned that you\u2019re Bene Gesserit,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are\nlegends here about the Bene Gesserit.\u201d\nThe Missionaria Protectiva, Jessica thought. No place escapes them.\n\u201cDoes this mean Duncan was successful?\u201d she asked. \u201cWill the Fremen be\nour allies?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing definite,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wish to observe us for a while,\nDuncan believes. They did, however, promise to stop raiding our outlying\nvillages during a truce period. That\u2019s a more important gain than it might\nseem. Hawat tells me the Fremen were a deep thorn in the Harkonnen side,\nthat the extent of their ravages was a carefully guarded secret. It wouldn\u2019t\nhave helped for the Emperor to learn the ineffectiveness of the Harkonnen\nmilitary.\u201d\n\u201cA Fremen housekeeper,\u201d Jessica mused, returning to the subject of the\nShadout Mapes. \u201cShe\u2019ll have the all-blue eyes.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t let the appearance of these people deceive you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a\ndeep strength and healthy vitality in them. I think they\u2019ll be everything we\nneed.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous gamble,\u201d she said.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not go into that again,\u201d he said.\nShe forced a smile. \u201cWe are committed, no doubt of that.\u201d She went\nthrough the quick regimen of calmness\u2014the two deep breaths, the ritual\nthought, then: \u201cWhen I assign rooms, is there anything special I should\nreserve for you?\u201d\n\u201cYou must teach me someday how you do that,\u201d he said, \u201cthe way you\nthrust your worries aside and turn to practical matters. It must be a Bene\n"
