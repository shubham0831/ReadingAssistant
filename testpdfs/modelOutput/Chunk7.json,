    "userPrompt": "purpose? What could it have been? She loved me, certainly.\nFor the first time, he was caught up in the thought that he might be part of\na pattern more involuted and complicated than his mind could grasp.\nJessica stopped beside him, said: \u201cWhat delicious abandon in the sleep of a\nchild.\u201d\nHe spoke mechanically: \u201cIf only adults could relax like that.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhere do we lose it?\u201d he murmured.\nShe glanced at him, catching the odd tone, but her mind was still on Paul,\nthinking of the new rigors in his training here, thinking of the differences in\nhis life now\u2014so very different from the life they once had planned for him.\n\u201cWe do, indeed, lose something,\u201d she said.\nShe glanced out to the right at a slope humped with a wind-troubled gray-\ngreen of bushes\u2014dusty leaves and dry claw branches. The too-dark sky hung\nover the slope like a blot, and the milky light of the Arrakeen sun gave the\nscene a silver cast\u2014light like the crysknife concealed in her bodice.\n\u201cThe sky\u2019s so dark,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s partly the lack of moisture,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWater!\u201d she snapped. \u201cEverywhere you turn here, you\u2019re involved with\nthe lack of water!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the precious mystery of Arrakis,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhy is there so little of it? There\u2019s volcanic rock here. There\u2019re a dozen\npower sources I could name. There\u2019s polar ice. They say you can\u2019t drill in the\ndesert\u2014storms and sandtides destroy equipment faster than it can be\ninstalled, if the worms don\u2019t get you first. They\u2019ve never found water traces\nthere, anyway. But the mystery, Wellington, the real mystery is the wells\nthat\u2019ve been drilled up here in the sinks and basins. Have you read about\nthose?\u201d\n\u201cFirst a trickle, then nothing,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut, Wellington, that\u2019s the mystery. The water was there. It dries up. And\nnever again is there water. Yet another hole nearby produces the same result:\na trickle that stops. Has no one ever been curious about this?\u201d\n\u201cIt is curious,\u201d he said. \u201cYou suspect some living agency? Wouldn\u2019t that\nhave shown in core samples?\u201d\n\u201cWhat would have shown? Alien plant matter ... or animal? Who could\nrecognize it?\u201d She turned back to the slope. \u201cThe water is stopped.\nSomething plugs it. That\u2019s my suspicion.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps the reason\u2019s known,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Harkonnens sealed off many\nsources of information about Arrakis. Perhaps there was reason to suppress\nthis.\u201d\n\u201cWhat reason?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the atmospheric moisture.\nLittle enough of it, certainly, but there\u2019s some. It\u2019s the major source of water\nhere, caught in windtraps and precipitators. Where does that come from?\u201d\n\u201cThe polar caps?\u201d\n\u201cCold air takes up little moisture, Wellington. There are things here behind\nthe Harkonnen veil that bear close investigation, and not all of those things\nare directly involved with the spice.\u201d\n\u201cWe are indeed behind the Harkonnen veil,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019ll....\u201d He\nbroke off, noting the sudden intense way she was looking at him. \u201cIs\nsomething wrong?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you say \u2018Harkonnen,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cEven my Duke\u2019s voice\ndoesn\u2019t carry that weight of venom when he uses the hated name. I didn\u2019t\nknow you had personal reasons to hate them, Wellington.\u201d\nGreat Mother! he thought. I\u2019ve aroused her suspicions! Now I must use\nevery trick my Wanna taught me. There\u2019s only one solution: tell the truth as\nfar as I can.\nHe said: \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that my wife, my Wanna....\u201d He shrugged,\nunable to speak past a sudden constriction in his throat. Then: \u201cThey....\u201d The\nwords would not come out. He felt panic, closed his eyes tightly,\nexperiencing the agony in his chest and little else until a hand touched his\narm gently. \u201cForgive me,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cI did not mean to open an old\nwound.\u201d And she thought: Those animals! His wife was Bene Gesserit \u2014the\nsigns are all over him. And it\u2019s obvious the Harkonnens killed her. Here\u2019s\nanother poor victim bound to the Atreides by a cherem of hate.\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m unable to talk about it.\u201d He opened his eyes,\ngiving himself up to the internal awareness of grief. That, at least, was truth.\nJessica studied him, seeing the up-angled cheeks, the dark sequins of\nalmond eyes, the butter complexion, and stringy mustache hanging like a\ncurved frame around purpled lips and narrow chin. The creases of his cheeks\nand forehead, she saw, were as much lines of sorrow as of age. A deep\naffection for him came over her.\n\u201cWellington, I\u2019m sorry we brought you into this dangerous place,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\u201cI came willingly,\u201d he said. And that, too, was true.\n\u201cBut this whole planet\u2019s a Harkonnen trap. You must know that.\u201d\n\u201cIt will take more than a trap to catch the Duke Leto,\u201d he said. And that,\ntoo, was true.\n\u201cPerhaps I should be more confident of him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is a brilliant\ntactician.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been uprooted,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re uneasy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how easy it is to kill the uprooted plant,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially when\nyou put it down in hostile soil.\u201d\n\u201cAre we certain the soil\u2019s hostile?\u201d\n\u201cThere were water riots when it was learned how many people the Duke\nwas adding to the population,\u201d she said. \u201cThey stopped only when the people\nlearned we were installing new windtraps and condensers to take care of the\nload.\u201d\n\u201cThere is only so much water to support human life here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe\npeople know if more come to drink a limited amount of water, the price goes\nup and the very poor die. But the Duke has solved this. It doesn\u2019t follow that\nthe riots mean permanent hostility toward him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd guards,\u201d she said. \u201cGuards everywhere. And shields. You see the\nblurring of them everywhere you look. We did not live this way on Caladan.\u201d\n\u201cGive this planet a chance,\u201d he said.\nBut Jessica continued to stare hard-eyed out the window. \u201cI can smell\ndeath in this place,\u201d she said. \u201cHawat sent advance agents in here by the\nbattalion. Those guards outside are his men. The cargo handlers are his men.\nThere\u2019ve been unexplained withdrawals of large sums from the treasury. The\namounts mean only one thing: bribes in high places.\u201d She shook her head.\n\u201cWhere Thufir Hawat goes, death and deceit follow.\u201d\n\u201cYou malign him.\u201d\n\u201cMalign? I praise him. Death and deceit are our only hopes now. I just do\nnot fool myself about Thufir\u2019s methods.\u201d\n\u201cYou should ... keep busy,\u201d he said. \u201cGive yourself no time for such\nmorbid\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBusy! What is it that takes most of my time, Wellington? I am the Duke\u2019s\nsecretary\u2014so busy that each day I learn new things to fear ... things even he\ndoesn\u2019t suspect I know.\u201d She compressed her lips, spoke thinly: \u201cSometimes\nI wonder how much my Bene Gesserit business training figured in his choice\nof me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He found himself caught by the cynical tone, the\nbitterness that he had never seen her expose.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think, Wellington,\u201d she asked, \u201cthat a secretary bound to one\nby love is so much safer?\u201d\n\u201cThat is not a worthy thought, Jessica.\u201d\nThe rebuke came naturally to his lips. There was no doubt how the Duke\nfelt about his concubine. One had only to watch him as he followed her with\nhis eyes.\nShe sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not worthy.\u201d\nAgain, she hugged herself, pressing the sheathed crysknife against her\nflesh and thinking of the unfinished business it represented.\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be much bloodshed soon,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Harkonnens won\u2019t rest\nuntil they\u2019re dead or my Duke destroyed. The Baron cannot forget that Leto\nis a cousin of the royal blood\u2014no matter what the distance\u2014while the\nHarkonnen titles came out of the CHOAM pocketbook. But the poison in\nhim, deep in his mind, is the knowledge that an Atreides had a Harkonnen\nbanished for cowardice after the Battle of Corrin.\u201d\n\u201cThe old feud,\u201d Yueh muttered. And for a moment he felt an acid touch of\nhate. The old feud had trapped him in its web, killed his Wanna or\u2014worse\u2014\nleft her for Harkonnen tortures until her husband did their bidding. The old\nfeud had trapped him and these people were part of that poisonous thing. The\nirony was that such deadliness should come to flower here on Arrakis, the\none source in the universe of melange, the prolonger of life, the giver of\nhealth.\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI am thinking that the spice brings six hundred and twenty thousand\nsolaris the decagram on the open market right now. That is wealth to buy\nmany things.\u201d\n\u201cDoes greed touch even you, Wellington?\u201d\n\u201cNot greed.\u201d\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cFutility.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cCan you remember your first\ntaste of spice?\u201d\n\u201cIt tasted like cinnamon.\u201d\n\u201cBut never twice the same,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like life\u2014it presents a different\nface each time you take it. Some hold that the spice produces a learned-flavor\nreaction. The body, learning a thing is good for it, interprets the flavor as\npleasurable\u2014slightly euphoric. And, like life, never to be truly synthesized.\u201d\n\u201cI think it would\u2019ve been wiser for us to go renegade, to take ourselves\nbeyond the Imperial reach,\u201d she said.\nHe saw that she hadn\u2019t been listening to him, focused on her words,\nwondering: Yes\u2014why didn\u2019t she make him do this? She could make him do\nvirtually anything.\nHe spoke quickly because here was truth and a change of subject: \u201cWould\nyou think it bold of me ... Jessica, if I asked a personal question?\u201d\nShe pressed against the window ledge in an unexplainable pang of\ndisquiet. \u201cOf course not. You\u2019re ... my friend.\u201d\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you made the Duke marry you?\u201d\nShe whirled, head up, glaring. \u201cMade him marry me? But\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI should not have asked,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s good political reason\u2014as long as my Duke\nremains unmarried some of the Great Houses can still hope for alliance.\nAnd....\u201d She sighed. \u201c... motivating people, forcing them to your will, gives\nyou a cynical attitude toward humanity. It degrades everything it touches. If I\nmade him do ... this, then it would not be his doing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thing my Wanna might have said,\u201d he murmured. And this, too, was\ntruth. He put a hand to his mouth, swallowing convulsively. He had never\nbeen closer to speaking out, confessing his secret role.\nJessica spoke, shattering the moment. \u201cBesides, Wellington, the Duke is\nreally two men. One of them I love very much. He\u2019s charming, witty,\nconsiderate ... tender\u2014everything a woman could desire. But the other man is\n... cold, callous, demanding, selfish\u2014as harsh and cruel as a winter wind.\nThat\u2019s the man shaped by the father.\u201d Her face contorted. \u201cIf only that old\nman had died when my Duke was born!\u201d\nIn the silence that came between them, a breeze from a ventilator could be\nheard fingering the blinds.\nPresently, she took a deep breath, said, \u201cLeto\u2019s right\u2014these rooms are\nnicer than the ones in the other sections of the house.\u201d She turned, sweeping\nthe room with her gaze. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, Wellington, I want another\nlook through this wing before I assign quarters.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d And he thought: If only there were some way not\nto do this thing that I must do.\nJessica dropped her arms, crossed to the hall door and stood there a\nmoment, hesitating, then let herself out. All the time we talked he was hiding\nsomething, holding something back, she thought. To save my feelings, no\ndoubt. He\u2019s a good man. Again, she hesitated, almost turned back to confront\nYueh and drag the hidden thing from him. But that would only shame him,\nfrighten him to learn he\u2019s so easily read. I should place more trust in my\nfriends.\nMany have marked the speed with which Muad\u2018Dib learned\nthe necessities of Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know\nthe basis of this speed. For the others, we can say that\nMuad\u2019Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how\nto learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he\ncould learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not\nbelieve they can learn, and how many more believe learning to\nbe difficult. Muad\u2018Dib knew that every experience carries its\nlesson.\n\u2014from \u201cThe Humanity of Muad\u2019Dib\u201d by the Princess Irulan\nPAUL LAY on the bed feigning sleep. It had been easy to palm Dr. Yueh\u2019s\nsleeping tablet, to pretend to swallow it. Paul suppressed a laugh. Even his\nmother had believed him asleep. He had wanted to jump up and ask her\npermission to go exploring the house, but had realized she wouldn\u2019t approve.\nThings were too unsettled yet. No. This way was best.\nIf I slip out without asking I haven\u2019t disobeyed orders. And Iwill stay in the\nhouse where it\u2019s safe.\nHe heard his mother and Yueh talking in the other room. Their words were\nindistinct\u2014something about the spice ... the Harkonnens. The conversation\nrose and fell.\nPaul\u2019s attention went to the carved headboard of his bed\u2014a false\nheadboard attached to the wall and concealing the controls for this room\u2019s\nfunctions. A leaping fish had been shaped on the wood with thick brown\nwaves beneath it. He knew if he pushed the fish\u2019s one visible eye that would\nturn on the room\u2019s suspensor lamps. One of the waves, when twisted,\ncontrolled ventilation. Another changed the temperature.\nQuietly, Paul sat up in bed. A tall bookcase stood against the wall to his\nleft. It could be swung aside to reveal a closet with drawers along one side.\nThe handle on the door into the hall was patterned on an ornithopter thrust\nbar.\nIt was as though the room had been designed to entice him.\nThe room and this planet.\nHe thought of the filmbook Yueh had shown him\u2014\u201cArrakis: His Imperial\nMajesty\u2019s Desert Botanical Testing Station.\u201d It was an old filmbook from\nbefore discovery of the spice. Names flitted through Paul\u2019s mind, each with\nits picture imprinted by the book\u2019s mnemonic pulse: saguaro, burro bush,\ndate palm, sand verbena, evening primrose, barrel cactus, incense bush,\nsmoke tree, creosote bush ... kit fox, desert hawk, kangaroo mouse....\nNames and pictures, names and pictures from man\u2019s terranic past\u2014and\nmany to be found now nowhere else in the universe except here on Arrakis.\nSo many new things to learn about\u2014the spice.\nAnd the sandworms.\nA door closed in the other room. Paul heard his mother\u2019s footsteps\nretreating down the hall. Dr. Yueh, he knew, would find something to read\nand remain in the other room.\nNow was the moment to go exploring.\nPaul slipped out of the bed, headed for the bookcase door that opened into\nthe closet. He stopped at a sound behind him, turned. The carved headboard\nof the bed was folding down onto the spot where he had been sleeping. Paul\nfroze, and immobility saved his life.\nFrom behind the headboard slipped a tiny hunter-seeker no more than five\ncentimeters long. Paul recognized it at once\u2014a common assassination\nweapon that every child of royal blood learned about at an early age. It was a\nravening sliver of metal guided by some near-by hand and eye. It could\nburrow into moving flesh and chew its way up nerve channels to the nearest\nvital organ.\nThe seeker lifted, swung sideways across the room and back.\nThrough Paul\u2019s mind flashed the related knowledge, the hunter-seeker\nlimitations: Its compressed suspensor field distorted the room to reflect his\ntarget, the operator would be relying on motion\u2014anything that moved. A\nshield could slow a hunter, give time to destroy it, but Paul had put aside his\nshield on the bed. Lasguns would knock them down, but lasguns were\nexpensive and notoriously cranky of maintenance\u2014and there was always the\nperil of explosive pyrotechnics if the laser beam intersected a hot shield. The\nAtreides relied on their body shields and their wits.\nNow, Paul held himself in near catatonic immobility, knowing he had only\nhis wits to meet this threat.\nThe hunter-seeker lifted another half meter. It rippled through the slatted\nlight from the window blinds, back and forth, quartering the room.\nI must try to grab it, he thought. The suspensor field will make it slippery\non the bottom. I must grip tightly.\nThe thing dropped a half meter, quartered to the left, circled back around\nthe bed. A faint humming could be heard from it.\nWho is operating that thing? Paul wondered. It has to be someone near. I\ncould shout for Yueh, but it would take him the instant the door opened.\nThe hall door behind Paul creaked. A rap sounded there. The door opened.\nThe hunter-seeker arrowed past his head toward the motion.\nPaul\u2019s right hand shot out and down, gripping the deadly thing. It hummed\nand twisted in his hand, but his muscles were locked on it in desperation.\nWith a violent turn and thrust, he slammed the thing\u2019s nose against the metal\ndoorplate. He felt the crunch of it as the nose eye smashed and the seeker\nwent dead in his hand.\nStill, he held it\u2014to be certain.\nPaul\u2019s eyes came up, met the open stare of total blue from the Shadout\nMapes.\n\u201cYour father has sent for you,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are men in the hall to\nescort you.\u201d\nPaul nodded, his eyes and awareness focusing on this odd woman in a\nsacklike dress of bondsman brown. She was looking now at the thing\nclutched in his hand.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of suchlike,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would\u2019ve killed me, not so?\u201d\nHe had to swallow before he could speak. \u201cI ... was its target.\u201d\n\u201cBut it was coming for me.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you were moving.\u201d And he wondered: Who is this creature?\n\u201cThen you saved my life,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI saved both our lives.\u201d\n\u201cSeems like you could\u2019ve let it have me and made your own escape,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cThe Shadout Mapes, housekeeper.\u201d\nHow did you know where to find me?\u201d\n\u201cYour mother told me. I met her at the stairs to the weirding room down\nthe hall.\u201d She pointed to her right. \u201cYour father\u2019s men are still waiting.\u201d\nThose will be Hawat\u2019s men, he thought. We must find the operator of this\nthing.\n\u201cGo to my father\u2019s men,\u201d he said. \u201cTell them I\u2019ve caught a hunter-seeker\nin the house and they\u2019re to spread out and find the operator. Tell them to seal\noff the house and its grounds immediately. They\u2019ll know how to go about it.\nThe operator\u2019s sure to be a stranger among us.\u201d\nAnd he wondered: Could it be this creature? But he knew it wasn\u2019t. The\nseeker had been under control when she entered.\n\u201cBefore I do your bidding, manling,\u201d Mapes said, \u201cI must cleanse the way\nbetween us. You\u2019ve put a water burden on me that I\u2019m not sure I care to\nsupport. But we Fremen pay our debts\u2014be they black debts or white debts.\nAnd it\u2019s known to us that you\u2019ve a traitor in your midst. Who it is, we cannot\nsay, but we\u2019re certain sure of it. Mayhap there\u2019s the hand guided that flesh-\ncutter.\u201d\nPaul absorbed this in silence: a traitor. Before he could speak, the odd\nwoman whirled away and ran back toward the entry.\nHe thought to call her back, but there was an air about her that told him she\nwould resent it. She\u2019d told him what she knew and now she was going to do\nhis bidding. The house would be swarming with Hawat\u2019s men in a minute.\nHis mind went to other parts of that strange conversation: weirding room.\nHe looked to his left where she had pointed. We Fremen. So that was a\nFremen. He paused for the mnemonic blink that would store the pattern of\nher face in his memory-prune-wrinkled features darkly browned, blue-on-\nblue eyes without any white in them. He attached the label: The Shadout\nMapes.\nStill gripping the shattered seeker, Paul turned back into his room, scooped\nup his shield belt from the bed with his left hand, swung it around his waist\nand buckled it as he ran back out and down the hall to the left.\nShe\u2019d said his mother was someplace down here\u2014stairs ... a weirding\nroom.\n"
