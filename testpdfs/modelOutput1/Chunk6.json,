    "userPrompt": "Gesserit thing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a female thing,\u201d she said.\nHe smiled. \u201cWell, assignment of rooms: make certain I have large office\nspace next to my sleeping quarters. There\u2019ll be more paper work here than on\nCaladan. A guard room, of course. That should cover it. Don\u2019t worry about\nsecurity of the house. Hawat\u2019s men have been over it in depth.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they have.\u201d\nHe glanced at his wristwatch. \u201cAnd you might see that all our timepieces\nare adjusted for Arrakeen local. I\u2019ve assigned a tech to take care of it. He\u2019ll\nbe along presently.\u201d He brushed a strand of her hair back from her forehead.\n\u201cI must return to the landing field now. The second shuttle\u2019s due any minute\nwith my staff reserves.\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t Hawat meet them, my Lord? You look so tired.\u201d\n\u201cThe good Thufir is even busier than I am. You know this planet\u2019s infested\nwith Harkonnen intrigues. Besides, I must try persuading some of the trained\nspice hunters against leaving. They have the option, you know, with the\nchange of fief\u2014and this planetologist the Emperor and the Landsraad\ninstalled as Judge of the Change cannot be bought. He\u2019s allowing the opt.\nAbout eight hundred trained hands expect to go out on the spice shuttle and\nthere\u2019s a Guild cargo ship standing by.\u201d\n\u201cMy Lord....\u201d She broke off, hesitating.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nHe will not be persuaded against trying to make this planet secure for us,\nshe thought. And I cannot use my tricks on him.\n\u201cAt what time will you be expecting dinner?\u201d she asked.\nThat\u2019s not what she was going to say, he thought Ah-h-h-h, my Jessica,\nwould that we were somewhere else, anywhere away from this terrible place\n\u2014alone, the two of us, without a care.\n\u201cI\u2019ll eat in the officers\u2019 mess at the field,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t expect me until\nvery late. And ... ah, I\u2019ll be sending a guardcar for Paul. I want him to attend\nour strategy conference.\u201d\nHe cleared his throat as though to say something else, then, without\nwarning, turned and strode out, headed for the entry where she could hear\nmore boxes being deposited. His voice sounded once from there,\ncommanding and disdainful, the way he always spoke to servants when he\nwas in a hurry: \u201cThe Lady Jessica\u2019s in the Great Hall. Join her there\nimmediately.\u201d\nThe outer door slammed.\nJessica turned away, faced the painting of Leto\u2019s father. It had been done\nby the famed artist, Albe, during the Old Duke\u2019s middle years. He was\nportrayed in matador costume with a magenta cape flung over his left arm.\nThe face looked young, hardly older than Leto\u2019s now, and with the same\nhawk features, the same gray stare. She clenched her fists at her sides, glared\nat the painting.\n\u201cDamn you! Damn you! Damn you!\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cWhat are your orders, Noble Born?\u201d\nIt was a woman\u2019s voice, thin and stringy.\nJessica whirled, stared down at a knobby, gray-haired woman in a\nshapeless sack dress of bondsman brown. The woman looked as wrinkled and\ndesiccated as any member of the mob that had greeted them along the way\nfrom the landing field that morning. Every native she had seen on this planet,\nJessica thought, looked prune dry and undernourished. Yet, Leto had said\nthey were strong and vital. And there were the eyes, of course\u2014that wash of\ndeepest, darkest blue without any white\u2014secretive, mysterious. Jessica\nforced herself not to stare.\nThe woman gave a stiff-necked nod, said: \u201cI am called the Shadout Mapes,\nNoble Born. What are your orders?\u201d\n\u201cYou may refer to me as \u2018my Lady,\u2019 \u201d Jessica said. \u201cI\u2019m not noble born.\nI\u2019m the bound concubine of the Duke Leto.\u201d\nAgain that strange nod, and the woman peered upward at Jessica with a sly\nquestioning. \u201cThere\u2019s a wife, then?\u201d\n\u201cThere is not, nor has there ever been. I am the Duke\u2019s only ... companion,\nthe mother of his heir-designate.\u201d\nEven as she spoke, Jessica laughed inwardly at the pride behind her words.\nWhat was it St. Augustine said? she asked herself. \u201cThe mind commands the\nbody and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance. \u201d Yes\u2014I am\nmeeting more resistance lately. I could use a quiet retreat by myself.\nA weird cry sounded from the road outside the house. It was repeated:\n\u201cSoo-soo-Sook! Soo-soo-Sook!\u201d Then: \u201cIkhut-eigh! Ikhut-eigh!\u201d And again:\n\u201cSoo-soo-Sook!\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Jessica asked. \u201cI heard it several times as we drove through\nthe streets this morning.\u201d\n\u201cOnly a water-seller, my Lady. But you\u2019ve no need to interest yourself in\nsuch as they. The cistern here holds fifty thousand liters and it\u2019s always kept\nfull.\u201d She glanced down at her dress. \u201cWhy, you know, my Lady, I don\u2019t\neven have to wear my stillsuit here?\u201d She cackled. \u201cAnd me not even dead!\u201d\nJessica hesitated, wanting to question this Fremen woman, needing data to\nguide her. But bringing order of the confusion in the castle was more\nimperative. Still, she found the thought unsettling that water was a major\nmark of wealth here.\n\u201cMy husband told me of your title, Shadout,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cI recognized\nthe word. It\u2019s a very ancient word.\u201d\n\u201cYou know the ancient tongues then?\u201d Mapes asked, and she waited with\nan odd intensity.\n\u201cTongues are the Bene Gesserit\u2019s first learning,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cI know the\nBhotani Jib and the Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.\u201d\nMapes nodded. \u201cJust as the legend says.\u201d\nAnd Jessica wondered: Why do Iplayout this sham? But the Bene Gesserit\nways were devious and compelling.\n\u201cI know the Dark Things and the ways of the Great Mother,\u201d Jessica said.\nShe read the more obvious signs in Mapes\u2019 actions and appearance, the petit\nbetrayals. \u201cMiseces prejia,\u201d she said in the Chakobsa tongue. \u201cAndral t\u2019re\npera! Trada cik buscakri miseces perakri\u2014\u201d\nMapes took a backward step, appeared poised to flee.\n\u201cI know many things,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cI know that you have borne children,\nthat you have lost loved ones, that you have hidden in fear and that you have\ndone violence and will yet do more violence. I know many things.\u201d\nIn a low voice, Mapes said: \u201cI meant no offense, my Lady.\u201d\n\u201cYou speak of the legend and seek answers,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cBeware the\nanswers you may find. I know you came prepared for violence with a weapon\nin your bodice.\u201d\n\u201cMy Lady, I....\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a remote possibility you could draw my life\u2019s blood,\u201d Jessica\nsaid, \u201cbut in so doing you\u2019d bring down more ruin than your wildest fears\ncould imagine. There are worse things than dying, you know\u2014even for an\nentire people.\u201d\n\u201cMy Lady!\u201d Mapes pleaded. She appeared about to fall to her knees. \u201cThe\nweapon was sent as a gift to you should you prove to be the One.\u201d\n\u201cAnd as the means of my death should I prove otherwise,\u201d Jessica said.\nShe waited in the seeming relaxation that made the Bene Gesserit-trained so\nterrifying in combat.\nNow we see which way the decision tips, she thought.\nSlowly, Mapes reached into the neck of her dress, brought out a dark\nsheath. A black handle with deep finger ridges protruded from it. She took\nsheath in one hand and handle in the other, withdrew a milk-white blade, held\nit up. The blade seemed to shine and glitter with a light of its own. It was\ndouble-edged like a kindjal and the blade was perhaps twenty centimeters\nlong.\n\u201cDo you know this, my Lady?\u201d Mapes asked.\nIt could only be one thing, Jessica knew, the fabled crysknife of Arrakis,\nthe blade that had never been taken off the planet, and was known only by\nrumor and wild gossip.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crysknife,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSay it not lightly,\u201d Mapes said. \u201cDo you know its meaning?\u201d\nAnd Jessica thought: There was an edge to that question. Here\u2019s the\nreason this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. My\nanswer could precipitate violence or ... what? She seeks an answer from me:\nthe meaning of a knife. She\u2019s called the Shadout in the Chakobsa tongue.\nKnife, that\u2019s \u201cDeath Maker\u201d in Chakobsa. She\u2019s getting restive. I must\nanswer now. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer.\nJessica said: \u201cIt\u2019s a maker\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEighe-e-e-e-e-e!\u201d Mapes wailed. It was a sound of both grief and elation.\nShe trembled so hard the knife blade sent glittering shards of reflection\nshooting around the room.\nJessica waited, poised. She had intended to say the knife was a maker of\ndeath and then add the ancient word, but every sense warned her now, all the\ndeep training of alertness that exposed meaning in the most casual muscle\ntwitch.\nThe key word was ... maker.\nMaker? Maker.\nStill, Mapes held the knife as though ready to use it.\nJessica said: \u201cDid you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great\nMother, would not know the Maker?\u201d\nMapes lowered the knife. \u201cMy Lady, when one has lived with prophecy for\nso long, the moment of revelation is a shock.\u201d\nJessica thought about the prophecy\u2014the Shari-a and all the panoplia\npropheticus, a Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva dropped here long\ncenturies ago\u2014long dead, no doubt, but her purpose accomplished: the\nprotective legends implanted in these people against the day of a Bene\nGesserit\u2019s need.\nWell, that day had come.\nMapes returned knife to sheath, said: \u201cThis is an unfixed blade, my Lady.\nKeep it near you. More than a week away from flesh and it begins to\ndisintegrate. It\u2019s yours, a tooth of shai-hulud, for as long as you live.\u201d\nJessica reached out her right hand, risked a gamble: \u201cMapes, you\u2019ve\nsheathed that blade unblooded.\u201d\nWith a gasp, Mapes dropped the sheathed knife into Jessica\u2019s hand, tore\nopen the brown bodice, wailing: \u201cTake the water of my life!\u201d\nJessica withdrew the blade from its sheath. How it glittered! She directed\nthe point toward Mapes, saw a fear greater than death-panic come over the\nwoman. Poison in the point? Jessica wondered. She tipped up the point, drew\na delicate scratch with the blade\u2019s edge above Mapes\u2019 left breast. There was a\nthick welling of blood that stopped almost immediately. Ultrafast\ncoagulation, Jessica thought. A moisture-conserving mutation?\nShe sheathed the blade, said: \u201cButton your dress, Mapes.\u201d\nMapes obeyed, trembling. The eyes without whites stared at Jessica. \u201cYou\nare ours,\u201d she muttered. \u201cYou are the One.\u201d\nThere came another sound of unloading in the entry. Swiftly, Mapes\ngrabbed the sheathed knife, concealed it in Jessica\u2019s bodice. \u201cWho sees that\nknife must be cleansed or slain!\u201d she snarled. \u201cYou know that, my Lady!\u201d\nI know it now, Jessica thought.\nThe cargo handlers left without intruding on the Great Hall.\nMapes composed herself, said: \u201cThe uncleansed who have seen a crysknife\nmay not leave Arrakis alive. Never forget that, my Lady. You\u2019ve been\nentrusted with a crysknife.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cNow the thing must take\nits course. It cannot be hurried.\u201d She glanced at the stacked boxes and piled\ngoods around them. \u201cAnd there\u2019s work aplenty to while the time for us here.\u201d\nJessica hesitated. \u201cThe thing must take its course.\u201d That was a specific\ncatchphrase from the Missionaria Protectiva\u2019s stock of incantations\u2014The\ncoming of the Reverend Mother to free you.\nBut I\u2019m not a Reverend Mother, Jessica thought. And then: Great Mother!\nThey planted that one here! This must be a hideous place!\nIn matter-of-fact tones, Mapes said: \u201cWhat\u2019ll you be wanting me to do\nfirst, my Lady?\u201d\nInstinct warned Jessica to match that casual tone. She said: \u201cThe painting\nof the Old Duke over there, it must be hung on one side of the dining hall.\nThe bull\u2019s head must go on the wall opposite the painting.\u201d\nMapes crossed to the bull\u2019s head. \u201cWhat a great beast it must have been to\ncarry such a head,\u201d she said. She stooped. \u201cI\u2019ll have to be cleaning this first,\nwon\u2019t I, my Lady?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cBut there\u2019s dirt caked on its horns.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not dirt, Mapes. That\u2019s the blood of our Duke\u2019s father. Those horns\nwere sprayed with a transparent fixative within hours after this beast killed\nthe Old Duke.\u201d\nMapes stood up. \u201cAh, now!\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just blood,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cOld blood at that. Get some help hanging\nthese now. The beastly things are heavy.\u201d\n\u201cDid you think the blood bothered me?\u201d Mapes asked. \u201cI\u2019m of the desert\nand I\u2019ve seen blood aplenty.\u201d\n\u201cI ... see that you have,\u201d Jessica said.\n\u201cAnd some of it my own,\u201d Mapes said. \u201cMore\u2019n you drew with your puny\nscratch.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d rather I\u2019d cut deeper?\u201d\n\u201cAh, no! The body\u2019s water is scant enough \u2018thout gushing a wasteful lot of\nit into the air. You did the thing right.\u201d\nAnd Jessica, noting the words and manner, caught the deeper implications\nin the phrase, \u201cthe body\u2019s water.\u201d Again she felt a sense of oppression at the\nimportance of water on Arrakis.\n\u201cOn which side of the dining hall shall I hang which one of these pretties,\nmy Lady?\u201d Mapes asked.\nEver the practical one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. She said: \u201cUse your\nown judgment, Mapes. It makes no real difference.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, my Lady.\u201d Mapes stooped, began clearing wrappings and\ntwine from the head. \u201cKilled an old duke, did you?\u201d she crooned.\n\u201cShall I summon a handler to help you?\u201d Jessica asked.\n\u201cI\u2019ll manage, my Lady.\u201d\nYes, she\u2019ll manage, Jessica thought. There\u2019s that about this Fremen\ncreature: the drive to manage.\nJessica felt the cold sheath of the crysknife beneath her bodice, thought of\nthe long chain of Bene Gesserit scheming that had forged another link here.\nBecause of that scheming, she had survived a deadly crisis. \u201cIt cannot be\nhurried,\u201d Mapes had said. Yet there was a tempo of headlong rushing to this\nplace that filled Jessica with foreboding. And not all the preparations of the\nMissionaria Protectiva nor Hawat\u2019s suspicious inspection of this castellated\npile of rocks could dispel the feeling.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve finished hanging those, start unpacking the boxes,\u201d Jessica\nsaid. \u201cOne of the cargo men at the entry has all the keys and knows where\nthings should go. Get the keys and the list from him. If there are any\nquestions I\u2019ll be in the south wing.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will, my Lady,\u201d Mapes said.\nJessica turned away, thinking: Hawat may have passed this residency as\nsafe, but there\u2019s something wrong about the place. I can feel it.\nAn urgent need to see her son gripped Jessica. She began walking toward\nthe arched doorway that led into the passage to the dining hall and the family\nwings. Faster and faster she walked until she was almost running.\nBehind her, Mapes paused in clearing the wrappings from the bull\u2019s head,\nlooked at the retreating back. \u201cShe\u2019s the One all right,\u201d she muttered. \u201cPoor\nthing.\u201d\n\u201cYueh! Yueh! Yueh!\u201d goes the refrain. \u201cA million deaths\nwere not enough for Yueh!\u201d\n\u2014from\u201cA Child\u2019s History of Muad\u2019Dib\u201d by the Princess Irulan\nTHE DOOR stood ajar, and Jessica stepped through it into a room with\nyellow walls. To her left stretched a low settee of black hide and two empty\nbookcases, a hanging waterflask with dust on its bulging sides. To her right,\nbracketing another door, stood more empty bookcases, a desk from Caladan\nand three chairs. At the windows directly ahead of her stood Dr. Yueh, his\nback to her, his attention fixed upon the outside world.\nJessica took another silent step into the room.\nShe saw that Yueh\u2019s coat was wrinkled, a white smudge near the left\nelbow as though he had leaned against chalk. He looked, from behind, like a\nfleshless stick figure in overlarge black clothing, a caricature poised for\nstringy movement at the direction of a puppet master. Only the squarish block\nof head with long ebony hair caught in its silver Suk School ring at the\nshoulder seemed alive\u2014turning slightly to follow some movement outside.\nAgain, she glanced around the room, seeing no sign of her son, but the\nclosed door on her right, she knew, let into a small bedroom for which Paul\nhad expressed a liking.\n\u201cGood afternoon, Dr. Yueh,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Paul?\u201d\nHe nodded as though to something out the window, spoke in an absent\nmanner without turning: \u201cYour son grew tired, Jessica. I sent him into the\nnext room to rest.\u201d\nAbruptly, he stiffened, whirled with mustache flopping over his purpled\nlips. \u201cForgive me, my Lady! My thoughts were far away ... I ... did not mean\nto be familiar.\u201d\nShe smiled, held out her right hand. For a moment, she was afraid he might\nkneel. \u201cWellington, please.\u201d\n\u201cTo use your name like that ... I....\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other six years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s long past time\nformalities should\u2019ve been dropped between us\u2014in private.\u201d\nYueh ventured a thin smile, thinking: I believe it has worked. Now, she\u2019ll\nthink anything unusual in my manner is due to embarrassment. She\u2019ll not\nlook for deeper reasons when she believes she already knows the answer.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I was woolgathering,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever I ... feel especially\nsorry for you, I\u2019m afraid I think of you as ... well, Jessica.\u201d\n\u201cSorry for me? Whatever for?\u201d\nYueh shrugged. Long ago, he had realized Jessica was not gifted with the\nfull Truthsay as his Wanna had been. Still, he always used the truth with\nJessica whenever possible. It was safest.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen this place, my ... Jessica.\u201d He stumbled over the name,\nplunged ahead: \u201cSo barren after Caladan. And the people! Those\ntownswomen we passed on the way here wailing beneath their veils. The way\nthey looked at us.\u201d\nShe folded her arms across her breast, hugging herself, feeling the\ncrysknife there, a blade ground from a sandworm\u2019s tooth, if the reports were\nright. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we\u2019re strange to them\u2014different people, different\ncustoms. They\u2019ve known only the Harkonnens.\u201d She looked past him out the\nwindows. \u201cWhat were you staring at out there?\u201d\nHe turned back to the window. \u201cThe people.\u201d\nJessica crossed to his side, looked to the left toward the front of the house\nwhere Yueh\u2019s attention was focused. A line of twenty palm trees grew there,\nthe ground beneath them swept clean, barren. A screen fence separated them\nfrom the road upon which robed people were passing. Jessica detected a faint\nshimmering in the air between her and the people\u2014a house shield\u2014and went\non to study the passing throng, wondering why Yueh found them so\nabsorbing.\nThe pattern emerged and she put a hand to her cheek. The way the passing\npeople looked at the palm trees! She saw envy, some hate ... even a sense of\nhope. Each person raked those trees with a fixity of expression.\n\u201cDo you know what they\u2019re thinking?\u201d Yueh asked.\n\u201cYou profess to read minds?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cThose minds,\u201d he said. \u201cThey look at those trees and they think: \u2018There\nare one hundred of us.\u2019 That\u2019s what they think.\u201d\nShe turned a puzzled frown on him. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cThose are date palms,\u201d he said. \u201cOne date palm requires forty liters of\nwater a day. A man requires but eight liters. A palm, then, equals five men.\nThere are twenty palms out there\u2014one hundred men.\u201d\n\u201cBut some of those people look at the trees hopefully.\u201d\n\u201cThey but hope some dates will fall, except it\u2019s the wrong season.\u201d\n\u201cWe look at this place with too critical an eye,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s hope as\nwell as danger here. The spice could make us rich. With a fat treasury, we can\nmake this world into whatever we wish.\u201d\nAnd she laughed silently at herself: Who am I trying to convince? The\nlaugh broke through her restraints, emerging brittle, without humor. \u201cBut you\ncan\u2019t buy security,\u201d she said.\nYueh turned away to hide his face from her. If only it were possible to hate\nthese people instead of love them! In her manner, in many ways, Jessica was\nlike his Wanna. Yet that thought carried its own rigors, hardening him to his\npurpose. The ways of the Harkonnen cruelty were devious. Wanna might not\nbe dead. He had to be certain.\n\u201cDo not worry for us, Wellington,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cThe problem\u2019s ours, not\nyours.\u201d\nShe thinks I worry for her! He blinked back tears. And I do, of course. But\nI must stand before that black Baron with his deed accomplished, and take\nmy one chance to strike him where he is weakest\u2014in his gloating moment!\nHe sighed.\n\u201cWould it disturb Paul if I looked in on him?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNot at all. I gave him a sedative.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s taking the change well?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cExcept for getting a bit overtired. He\u2019s excited, but what fifteen-year-old\nwouldn\u2019t be under these circumstances?\u201d He crossed to the door, opened it.\n\u201cHe\u2019s in here.\u201d\nJessica followed, peered into a shadowy room.\nPaul lay on a narrow cot, one arm beneath a light cover, the other thrown\nback over his head. Slatted blinds at a window beside the bed wove a loom of\nshadows across face and blanket.\nJessica stared at her son, seeing the oval shape of face so like her own. But\nthe hair was the Duke\u2019s\u2014coal-colored and tousled. Long lashes concealed\nthe lime-toned eyes. Jessica smiled, feeling her fears retreat. She was\nsuddenly caught by the idea of genetic traces in her son\u2019s features\u2014her lines\nin eyes and facial outline, but sharp touches of the father peering through that\noutline like maturity emerging from childhood.\nShe thought of the boy\u2019s features as an exquisite distillation out of random\npatterns\u2014endless queues of happenstance meeting at this nexus. The thought\nmade her want to kneel beside the bed and take her son in her arms, but she\nwas inhibited by Yueh\u2019s presence. She stepped back, closed the door softly.\nYueh had returned to the window, unable to bear watching the way Jessica\nstared at her son. Why did Wanna never give me children? he asked himself. I\nknow as a doctor there was no physical reason against it. Was there some\nBene Gesserit reason? Was she, perhaps, instructed to serve a different\n"
