    "userPrompt": "there\u2019s another matter bears discussion. We both know how constant a watch\nwe must keep to prevent traitors from infiltrating our forces... but I have two\nnew reports.\u201d\nHawat turned, stared at him.\nAnd Leto repeated the stories Paul had brought.\nInstead of bringing on the intense Mentat concentration, the reports only\nincreased Hawat\u2019s agitation.\nLeto studied the old man and, presently, said: \u201cYou\u2019ve been holding\nsomething back, old friend. I should\u2019ve suspected when you were so nervous\nduring Staff. What is it that was too hot to dump in front of the full\nconference?\u201d\nHawat\u2019s sapho-stained lips were pulled into a prim, straight line with tiny\nwrinkles radiating into them. They maintained their wrinkled stiffness as he\nsaid: \u201cMy Lord, I don\u2019t quite know how to broach this.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve suffered many a scar for each other, Thufir,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cYou\nknow you can broach any subject with me.\u201d\nHawat continued to stare at him, thinking: This is how I like him best. This\nis the man of honor who deserves every bit of my loyalty and service. Why\nmust I hurt him?\n\u201cWell?\u201d Leto demanded.\nHawat shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a scrap of a note. We took it from a Harkonnen\ncourier. The note was intended for an agent named Pardee. We\u2019ve good\nreason to believe Pardee was top man in the Harkonnen underground here.\nThe note\u2014it\u2019s a thing that could have great consequence or no consequence.\nIt\u2019s susceptible to various interpretations.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the delicate content of this note?\u201d\n\u201cScrap of a note, my Lord. Incomplete. It was on minimic film with the\nusual destruction capsule attached. We stopped the acid action just short of\nfull erasure, leaving only a fragment. The fragment, however, is extremely\nsuggestive.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nHawat rubbed at his lips. \u201cIt says: \u2018... eto will never suspect, and when the\nblow falls on him from a beloved hand, its source alone should be enough to\ndestroy him.\u2019 The note was under the Baron\u2019s own seal and I\u2019ve\nauthenticated the seal.\u201d\n\u201cYour suspicion is obvious,\u201d the Duke said and his voice was suddenly\ncold.\n\u201cI\u2019d sooner cut off my arms than hurt you,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cMy Lord, what\nif....\u201d\n\u201cThe Lady Jessica,\u201d Leto said, and he felt anger consuming him. \u201cCouldn\u2019t\nyou wring the facts out of this Pardee?\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, Pardee no longer was among the living when we\nintercepted the courier. The courier, I\u2019m certain, did not know what he\ncarried.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d\nLeto shook his head, thinking: What a slimy piece of business. There can\u2019t\nbe anything in it. I know my woman.\n\u201cMy Lord, if\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d the Duke barked. \u201cThere\u2019s a mistake here that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe cannot ignore it, my Lord.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s been with me for sixteen years! There\u2019ve been countless\nopportunities for\u2014You yourself investigated the school and the woman!\u201d\nHawat spoke bitterly: \u201cThings have been known to escape me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible, I tell you! The Harkonnens want to destroy the Atreides\nline\u2014meaning Paul, too. They\u2019ve already tried once. Could a woman\nconspire against her own son?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps she doesn\u2019t conspire against her son. And yesterday\u2019s attempt\ncould\u2019ve been a clever sham.\u201d\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been a sham.\u201d\n\u201cSire, she isn\u2019t supposed to know her parentage, but what if she does\nknow? What if she were an orphan, say, orphaned by an Atreides?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019d have moved long before now. Poison in my drink... a stiletto at\nnight. Who has had better opportunity?\u201d\n\u201cThe Harkonnens mean to destroy you, my Lord. Their intent is not just to\nkill. There\u2019s a range of fine distinctions in kanly. This could be a work of art\namong vendettas.\u201d\nThe Duke\u2019s shoulders slumped. He closed his eyes, looking old and tired.\nIt cannot be, he thought. The woman has opened her heart to me.\n\u201cWhat better way to destroy me than to sow suspicion of the woman I\nlove?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cAn interpretation I\u2019ve considered,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cStill....\u201d\nThe Duke opened his eyes, stared at Hawat, thinking: Let him be\nsuspicious. Suspicion is his trade, not mine. Perhaps if I appear to believe\nthis, that will make another man careless.\n\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d the Duke whispered.\n\u201cFor now, constant surveillance, my Lord. She should be watched at all\ntimes. I will see it\u2019s done unobtrusively. Idaho would be the ideal choice for\nthe job. Perhaps in a week or so we can bring him back. There\u2019s a young man\nwe\u2019ve been training in Idaho\u2019s troop who might be ideal to send to the\nFremen as a replacement. He\u2019s gifted in diplomacy.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t jeopardize our foothold with the Fremen.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not, Sir.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what about Paul?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps we could alert Dr. Yueh.\u201d\nLeto turned his back on Hawat. \u201cI leave it in your hands.\u201d\n\u201cI shall use discretion, my Lord.\u201d\nAt least I can count on that, Leto thought. And he said: \u201cI will take a walk.\nIf you need me, I\u2019ll be within the perimeter. The guard can\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy Lord, before you go, I\u2019ve a filmclip you should read. It\u2019s a first-\napproximation analysis on the Fremen religion. You\u2019ll recall you asked me to\nreport on it.\u201d\nThe Duke paused, spoke without turning. \u201cWill it not wait?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, my Lord. You asked what they were shouting, though. It was\n\u2018Mahdi!\u2019 They directed the term at the young master. When they\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAt Paul?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my Lord. They\u2019ve a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come\nto them, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them to true freedom. It follows the\nfamiliar messiah pattern.\u201d\n\u201cThey think Paul is this... this....\u201d\n\u201cThey only hope, my Lord.\u201d Hawat extended a filmclip capsule.\nThe Duke accepted it, thrust it into a pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll look at it later.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, my Lord.\u201d\n\u201cRight now, I need time to ... think.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my Lord.\u201d\nThe Duke took a deep sighing breath, strode out the door. He turned to his\nright down the hall, began walking, hands behind his back, paying little\nattention to where he was. There were corridors and stairs and balconies and\nhalls... people who saluted and stood aside for him.\nIn time he came back to the conference room, found it dark and Paul asleep\non the table with a guard\u2019s robe thrown over him and a ditty pack for a\npillow. The Duke walked softly down the length of the room and onto the\nbalcony overlooking the landing field. A guard at the corner of the balcony,\nrecognizing the Duke by the dim reflection of lights from the field, snapped\nto attention.\n\u201cAt ease,\u201d the Duke murmured. He leaned against the cold metal of the\nbalcony rail.\nA predawn hush had come over the desert basin. He looked up. Straight\noverhead, the stars were a sequin shawl flung over blue-black. Low on the\nsouthern horizon, the night\u2019s second moon peered through a thin dust haze\u2014\nan unbelieving moon that looked at him with a cynical light.\nAs the Duke watched, the moon dipped beneath the Shield Wall cliffs,\nfrosting them, and in the sudden intensity of darkness, he experienced a chill.\nHe shivered.\nAnger shot through him.\nThe Harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last\ntime, he thought. They are dung heaps with village provost minds! Here I\nmake my stand! And he thought with a touch of sadness: I must rule with eye\nand claw\u2014asthe hawk among lesser birds. Unconsciously, his hand brushed\nthe hawk emblem on his tunic.\nTo the east, the night grew a faggot of luminous gray, then seashell\nopalescence that dimmed the stars. There came the long, bell-tolling\nmovement of dawn striking across a broken horizon.\nIt was a scene of such beauty it caught all his attention.\nSome things beggar likeness, he thought.\nHe had never imagined anything here could be as beautiful as that\nshattered red horizon and the purple and ochre cliffs. Beyond the landing\nfield where the night\u2019s faint dew had touched life into the hurried seeds of\nArrakis, he saw great puddles of red blooms and, running through them, an\narticulate tread of violet... like giant footsteps.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful morning, Sire,\u201d the guard said.\n\u201cYes, it is.\u201d\nThe Duke nodded, thinking: Perhaps this planet could grow on one.\nPerhaps it could become a good home for my son.\nThen he saw the human figures moving into the flower fields, sweeping\nthem with strange scythe-like devices\u2014dew gatherers. Water so precious\nhere that even the dew must be collected.\nAnd it could be a hideous place, the Duke thought.\n\u201cThereis probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment\nthan the one in which you discover your father is a man\u2014with\nhuman flesh.\u201d\n\u2014from\u201cCollected Sayings of Muad\u2019Dib\u201d by the Princess Irulan\nTHE DUKE SAID: \u201cPaul, I\u2019m doing a hateful thing, but I must.\u201d He stood\nbeside the portable poison snooper that had been brought into the conference\nroom for their breakfast. The thing\u2019s sensor arms hung limply over the table,\nreminding Paul of some weird insect newly dead.\nThe Duke\u2019s attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and\nits roiling of dust against the morning sky.\nPaul had a viewer in front of him containing a short filmclip on Fremen\nreligious practices. The clip had been compiled by one of Hawat\u2019s experts\nand Paul found himself disturbed by the references to himself.\n\u201cMahdi!\u201d\n\u201cLisan al-Gaib!\u201d\nHe could close his eyes and recall the shouts of the crowds. So that is what\nthey hope, he thought. And he remembered what the old Reverend Mother\nhad said: Kwisatz Haderach. The memories touched his feelings of terrible\npurpose, shading this strange world with sensations of familiarity that he\ncould not understand.\n\u201cA hateful thing,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cWhat do you mean, sir?\u201d\nLeto turned, looked down at his son. \u201cBecause the Harkonnens think to\ntrick me by making me distrust your mother. They don\u2019t know that I\u2019d sooner\ndistrust myself.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand, sir.\u201d\nAgain, Leto looked out the windows. The white sun was well up into its\nmorning quadrant. Milky light picked out a boiling of dust clouds that spilled\nover into the blind canyons interfingering the Shield Wall.\nSlowly, speaking in a slow voice to contain his anger, the Duke explained\nto Paul about the mysterious note.\n\u201cYou might just as well mistrust me,\u201d Paul said.\n\u201cThey have to think they\u2019ve succeeded,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cThey must think\nme this much of a fool. It must look real. Even your mother may not know\nthe sham.\u201d\n\u201cBut, sir! Why?\u201d\n\u201cYour mother\u2019s response must not be an act. Oh, she\u2019s capable of a\nsupreme act... but too much rides on this. I hope to smoke out a traitor. It\nmust seem that I\u2019ve been completely cozened. She must be hurt this way that\nshe does not suffer greater hurt.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you tell me, Father? Maybe I\u2019ll give it away.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll not watch you in this thing,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cYou\u2019ll keep the\nsecret. You must.\u201d He walked to the windows, spoke without turning. \u201cThis\nway, if anything should happen to me, you can tell her the truth\u2014that I never\ndoubted her, not for the smallest instant. I should want her to know this.\u201d\nPaul recognized the death thoughts in his father\u2019s words, spoke quickly:\n\u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen to you, sir. The\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBe silent, Son.\u201d\nPaul stared at his father\u2019s back, seeing the fatigue in the angle of the neck,\nin the line of the shoulders, in the slow movements.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just tired, Father.\u201d\n\u201cI am tired,\u201d the Duke agreed. \u201cI\u2019m morally tired. The melancholy\ndegeneration of the Great Houses has afflicted me at last, perhaps. And we\nwere such strong people once.\u201d\nPaul spoke in quick anger: \u201cOur House hasn\u2019t degenerated!\u201d\n\u201cHasn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe Duke turned, faced his son, revealing dark circles beneath hard eyes, a\ncynical twist of mouth. \u201cI should wed your mother, make her my Duchess.\nYet... my unwedded state give some Houses hope they may yet ally with me\nthrough their marriageable daughters.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cSo, I....\u201d\n\u201cMother has explained this to me.\u201d\n\u201cNothing wins more loyalty for a leader than an air of bravura,\u201d the Duke\nsaid. \u201cI, therefore, cultivate an air of bravura.\u201d\n\u201cYou lead well,\u201d Paul protested. \u201cYou govern well. Men follow you\nwillingly and love you.\u201d\n\u201cMy propaganda corps is one of the finest,\u201d the Duke\u2019said. Again, he\nturned to stare out at the basin. \u201cThere\u2019s greater possibility for us here on\nArrakis than the Imperium could ever suspect. Yet sometimes I think it\u2019d\nhave been better if we\u2019d run for it, gone renegade. Sometimes I wish we\ncould sink back into anonymity among the people, become less exposed\nto....\u201d\n\u201cFather!\u201d\n\u201cYes, I am tired,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cDid you know we\u2019re using spice residue\nas raw material and already have our own factory to manufacture filmbase?\u201d\n\u201cSir?\u201d\n\u201cWe mustn\u2019t run short of filmbase,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cElse, how could we\nflood village and city with our information? The people must learn how well\nI govern them. How would they know if we didn\u2019t tell them?\u201d\n\u201cYou should get some rest,\u201d Paul said.\nAgain, the Duke faced his son. \u201cArrakis has another advantage I almost\nforgot to mention. Spice is in everything here. You breathe it and eat it in\nalmost everything. And I find that this imparts a certain natural immunity to\nsome of the most common poisons of the Assassins\u2019 Handbook. And the need\nto watch every drop of water puts all food production\u2014yeast culture,\nhydroponics, chemavit, everything\u2014under the strictest surveillance. We\ncannot kill off large segments of our population with poison\u2014and we cannot\nbe attacked this way, either. Arrakis makes us moral and ethical.\u201d\nPaul started to speak, but the Duke cut him off, saying: \u201cI have to have\nsomeone I can say these things to, Son.\u201d He sighed, glanced back at the dry\nlandscape where even the flowers were gone now\u2014trampled by the dew\ngatherers, wilted under the early sun.\n\u201cOn Caladan, we ruled with sea and air power,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cHere, we\nmust scrabble for desert power. This is your inheritance, Paul. What is to\nbecome of you if anything happens to me? You\u2019ll not be a renegade House,\nbut a guerrilla House\u2014running, hunted.\u201d\nPaul groped for words, could find nothing to say. He had never seen his\nfather this despondent.\n\u201cTo hold Arrakis,\u201d the Duke said, \u201cone is faced with decisions that may\ncost one his self-respect.\u201d He pointed out the window to the Atreides green\nand black banner hanging limply from a staff at the edge of the landing field.\n\u201cThat honorable banner could come to mean many evil things.\u201d\nPaul swallowed in a dry throat. His father\u2019s words carried futility, a sense\nof fatalism that left the boy with an empty feeling in his chest.\nThe Duke took an antifatigue tablet from a pocket, gulped it dry. \u201cPower\nand fear,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tools of statecraft. I must order new emphasis on\nguerrilla training for you. That filmclip there\u2014they call you \u2018Mahdi\u2019\u2014\u2018Lisan\nal-Gaib\u2019\u2014as a last resort, you might capitalize on that.\u201d\nPaul stared at his father, watching the shoulders straighten as the tablet did\nits work, but remembering the words of fear and doubt.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s keeping that ecologist?\u201d the Duke muttered. \u201cI told Thufir to have\nhim here early.\u201d\nMy father, the Padishah Emperor, took me by the hand one\nday and I sensed in the ways my mother had taught me that he\nwas disturbed. He led me down the Hall of Portraits to the ego-\nlikeness of the Duke Leto Atreides. I marked the strong\nresemblance between them\u2014my father and this man in the\nportrait\u2014bothwith thin, elegant faces and sharp features\ndominated by cold eyes. \u201cPrincess daughter,\u201d my father said,\n\u201cI would that you\u2019d been older when it came time for this man\nto choose a woman.\u201d My father was 71 at the time and looking\nno older than the man in the portrait, and I was but 14, yet I\nremember deducing in that instant that my father secretly\nwished the Duke had been his son, and disliked the political\nnecessities that made them enemies.\n\u2014\u201cIn my Father\u2019s House\u201d by Princess Irulan\nHIS FIRST encounter with the people he had been ordered to betray left\nDr. Kynes shaken. He prided himself on being a scientist to whom legends\nwere merely interesting clues, pointing toward cultural roots. Yet the boy\nfitted the ancient prophecy so precisely. He had \u201cthe questing eyes,\u201d and the\nair of \u201creserved candor.\u201d\nOf course, the prophecy left certain latitude as to whether the Mother\nGoddess would bring the Messiah with her or produce Him on the scene.\nStill, there was this odd correspondence between prediction and persons.\nThey met in midmorning outside the Arrakeen landing field\u2019s\nadministration building. An unmarked ornithopter squatted nearby. humming\nsoftly on standby like a somnolent insect. An Atreides guard stood beside it\nwith bared sword and the faint air-distortion of a shield around him.\nKynes sneered at the shield pattern, thinking: Arrakis has a surprise for\nthem there!\nThe planetologist raised a hand, signaled for his Fremen guard to fall back.\nHe strode on ahead toward the building\u2019s entrance\u2014the dark hole in plastic-\ncoated rock. So exposed, that monolithic building, he thought. So much less\nsuitable than a cave.\nMovement within the entrance caught his attention. He stopped, taking the\nmoment to adjust his robe and the set of his stillsuit at the left shoulder.\nThe entrance doors swung wide. Atreides guards emerged swiftly, all of\nthem heavily armed-slow-pellet stunners, swords and shields. Behind them\ncame a tall man, hawk-faced, dark of skin and hair. He wore a jubba cloak\nwith Atreides crest at the breast, and wore it in a way that betrayed his\nunfamiliarity with the garment. It clung to the legs of his stillsuit on one side.\nIt lacked a free-swinging, striding rhythm.\nBeside the man walked a youth with the same dark hair, but rounder in the\nface. The youth seemed small for the fifteen years Kynes knew him to have.\nBut the young body carried a sense of command, a poised assurance, as\nthough he saw and knew things all around him that were not visible to others.\nAnd he wore the same style cloak as his father, yet with casual ease that made\none think the boy had always worn such clothing.\n\u201cThe Mahdi will be aware of things others cannot see, \u201d went the\nprophecy.\nKynes shook his head, telling himself: They\u2019re just people.\nWith the two, garbed like them for the desert, came a man Kynes\nrecognized\u2014Gurney Halleck. Kynes took a deep breath to still his\nresentment against Halleck, who had briefed him on how to behave with the\nDuke and ducal heir.\n\u201cYou may call the Duke \u2018my Lord\u2019 or \u2018Sire.\u2019 \u2018Noble Born\u2019 also is correct,\nbut usually reserved for moreformal occasions. The son may be addressed as\n\u2018young Master\u2019 or \u2018my Lord.\u2019 The Duke is a man of much leniency, but\nbrooks little familiarity.\nAnd Kynes thought as he watched the group approach: They\u2019ll learn soon\nenough who\u2019s master on Arrakis. Order me questioned half the night by that\nMentat, will they? Expect me to guide them on an inspection of spice mining,\ndo they?\nThe import of Hawat\u2019s questions had not escaped Kynes. They wanted the\nImperial bases. And it was obvious they\u2019d learned of the bases from Idaho.\nI will have Stilgar send Idaho\u2019s head to this Duke, Kynes told himself.\nThe ducal party was only a few paces away now, their feet in desert boots\ncrunching the sand.\nKynes bowed. \u201cMy Lord, Duke.\u201d\nAs he had approached the solitary figure standing near the ornithopter,\nLeto had studied him: tall, thin, dressed for the desert in loose robe, stillsuit,\nand low boots. The man\u2019s hood was thrown back, its veil hanging to one side,\nrevealing long sandy hair, a sparse beard. The eyes were that fathomless\nblue-within-blue under thick brows. Remains of dark stains smudged his eye\nsockets.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the ecologist,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cWe prefer the old title here, my Lord,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cPlanetologist.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish,\u201d the Duke said. He glanced down at Paul. \u201cSon, this is the\nJudge of the Change, the arbiter of dispute, the man set here to see that the\nforms are obeyed in our assumption of power over this fief.\u201d He glanced at\nKynes. \u201cAnd this is my son.\u201d\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cAre you a Fremen?\u201d Paul asked.\nKynes smiled. \u201cI am accepted in both sietch and village, young Master.\nBut I am in His Majesty\u2019s service, the Imperial Planetologist.\u201d\nPaul nodded, impressed by the man\u2019s air of strength. Halleck had pointed\nKynes out to Paul from an upper window of the administration building:\n\u201cThe man standing there with the Fremen escort\u2014the one moving now\ntoward the ornithopter.\u201d\nPaul had inspected Kynes briefly with binoculars, noting the prim, straight\nmouth, the high forehead. Halleck had spoken in Paul\u2019s ear: \u201cOdd sort of\nfellow. Has a precise way of speaking\u2014clipped off, no fuzzy edges\u2014razor-\napt.\u201d\nAnd the Duke, behind them, had said: \u201cScientist type.\u201d\nNow, only a few feet from the man, Paul sensed the power in Kynes, the\nimpact of personality, as though he were blood royal, born to command.\n\u201cI understand we have you to thank for our stillsuits and these cloaks,\u201d the\nDuke said.\n\u201cI hope they fit well, my Lord,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cThey\u2019re of Fremen make and\nas near as possible the dimensions given me by your man Halleck here.\u201d\n\u201cI was concerned that you said you couldn\u2019t take us into the desert unless\nwe wore these garments,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cWe can carry plenty of water. We\ndon\u2019t intend to be out long and we\u2019ll have air cover\u2014the escort you see\noverhead right now. It isn\u2019t likely we\u2019d be forced down.\u201d\nKynes stared at him, seeing the water-fat flesh. He spoke coldly: \u201cYou\nnever talk of likelihoods on Arrakis. You speak only of possibilities.\u201d\nHalleck stiffened. \u201cThe Duke is to be addressed as my Lord or Sire!\u201d\nLeto gave Halleck their private handsignal to desist, said: \u201cOur ways are\nnew here, Gurney. We must make allowances.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish, Sire.\u201d\n\u201cWe are indebted to you, Dr. Kynes,\u201d Leto said. \u201cThese suits and the\nconsideration for our welfare will be remembered.\u201d\nOn impulse, Paul called to mind a quotation from the O.C. Bible, said:\n\u201c\u2018The gift is the blessing of the giver.\u2019 \u201d\nThe words rang out overloud in the still air. The Fremen escort Kynes had\nleft in the shade of the administration building leaped up from their squatting\n"
