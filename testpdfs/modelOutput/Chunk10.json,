    "userPrompt": "\u201cI don\u2019t like this de-emphasis on shields,\u201d the Duke muttered. And he\nthought: Is this the Harkonnen secret? Does it mean we won\u2019t even be able to\nescape on shielded frigates if all goes against us? He shook his head sharply\nto drive out such thoughts, said: \u201cLet\u2019s get to the working estimate. What\u2019ll\nour profit figure be?\u201d\nHawat turned two pages in his notebook. \u201cAfter assessing the repairs and\noperable equipment, we\u2019ve worked out a first estimate on operating costs. It\u2019s\nbased naturally on a depreciated figure for a clear safety margin.\u201d He closed\nhis eyes in Mentat semitrance, said: \u201cUnder the Harkonnens, maintenance\nand salaries were held to fourteen per cent. We\u2019ll be lucky to make it at thirty\nper cent at first. With reinvestment and growth factors accounted for,\nincluding the CHOAM percentage and military costs, our profit margin will\nbe reduced to a very narrow six or seven per cent until we can replace worn-\nout equipment. We then should be able to boost it up to twelve or fifteen per\ncent where it belongs.\u201d He opened his eyes. \u201cUnless my Lord wishes to adopt\nHarkonnen methods.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re working for a solid and permanent planetary base,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cWe have to keep a large percentage of the people happy\u2014especially the\nFremen.\u201d\n\u201cMost especially the Fremen,\u201d Hawat agreed.\n\u201cOur supremacy on Caladan,\u201d the Duke said, \u201cdepended on sea and air\npower. Here, we must develop something I choose to call desert power. This\nmay include air power, but it\u2019s possible it may not. I call your attention to the\nlack of \u2018thopter shields.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThe Harkonnens relied on\nturnover from off planet for some of their key personnel. We don\u2019t dare. Each\nnew lot would have its quota of provocateurs.\u201d\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to be content with far less profit and a reduced harvest,\u201d\nHawat said. \u201cOur output the first two seasons should be down a third from\nthe Harkonnen average.\u201d\n\u201cThere it is,\u201d the Duke said, \u201cexactly as we expected. \u201dWe\u2019ll have to move\nfast with the Fremen. I\u2019d like five full battalions of Fremen troops before the\nfirst CHOAM audit.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not much time, Sire,\u201d Hawat said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time, as you well know. They\u2019ll be here with\nSardaukar disguised as Harkonnens at the first opportunity. How many do\nyou think they\u2019ll ship in, Thufir?\u201d\n\u201cFour or five battalions all told, Sire. No more, Guild troop-transport costs\nbeing what they are.\u201d\n\u201cThen five battalions of Fremen plus our own forces ought to do it. Let us\nhave a few captive Sardaukar to parade in front of the Landsraad Council and\nmatters will be much different\u2014profits or no profits.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do our best, Sire.\u201d\nPaul looked at his father, back to Hawat, suddenly conscious of the\nMentat\u2019s great age, aware that the old man had served three generations of\nAtreides. Aged. It showed in the rheumy shine of the brown eyes, in the\ncheeks cracked and burned by exotic weathers, in the rounded curve of the\nshoulders and the thin set of his lips with the cranberry-colored stain of sapho\njuice.\nSo much depends on one aged man, Paul thought.\n\u201cWe\u2019re presently in a war of assassins,\u201d the Duke said, \u201cbut it has not\nachieved full scale. Thufir, what\u2019s the condition of the Harkonnen machine\nhere?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve eliminated two hundred and fifty-nine of their key people, my\nLord. No more than three Harkonnen cells remain\u2014perhaps a hundred\npeople in all.\u201d\n\u201cThese Harkonnen creatures you eliminated,\u201d the Duke said, \u201cwere they\npropertied?\u201d\n\u201cMost were well situated, my Lord\u2014in the entrepreneur class.\u201d\n\u201cI want you to forge certificates of allegiance over the signatures of each of\nthem,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cFile copies with the Judge of the Change. We\u2019ll take\nthe legal position that they stayed under false allegiance. Confiscate their\nproperty, take everything, turn out their families, strip them. And make sure\nthe Crown gets its ten per cent. It must be entirely legal.\u201d\nThufir smiled, revealing red-stained teeth beneath the carmine lips. \u201cA\nmove worthy of your grandsire, my Lord. It shames me I didn\u2019t think of it\nfirst.\u201d\nHalleck frowned across the table, noticing a deep scowl on Paul\u2019s face.\nThe others were smiling and nodding.\nIt\u2019s wrong, Paul thought. This\u2019ll only make the others fight all the harder.\nThey\u2019ve nothing to gain by surrendering.\nHe knew the actual no-holds-barred convention that ruled in kanly, but this\nwas the sort of move that could destroy them even as it gave them victory.\n\u201c \u2018I have been a stranger in a strange land,\u2019 \u201d Halleck quoted.\nPaul stared at him, recognizing the quotation from the O.C. Bible,\nwondering: Does Gurney, too, wish an end to devious plots?\nThe Duke glanced at the darkness out the windows, looked back at\nHalleck. \u201cGurney, how many of those sandworkers did you persuade to stay\nwith us?\u201d\n\u201cTwo hundred eighty-six in all, Sire. I think we should take them and\nconsider ourselves lucky. They\u2019re all in useful categories.\u201d\n\u201cNo more?\u201d The Duke pursed his lips, then: \u201cWell, pass the word along to\n\u2014\u201d\nA disturbance at the door interrupted him. Duncan Idaho came through the\nguard there, hurried down the length of the table and bent over the Duke\u2019s\near.\nLeto waved him back, said: \u201cSpeak out, Duncan. You can see this is\nstrategy staff.\u201d\nPaul studied Idaho, marking the feline movements, the swiftness of reflex\nthat made him such a difficult weapons teacher to emulate. Idaho\u2019s dark\nround face turned toward Paul, the cave-sitter eyes giving no hint of\nrecognition, but Paul recognized the mask of serenity over excitement.\nIdaho looked down the length of the table, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a force of\nHarkonnen mercenaries disguised as Fremen. The Fremen themselves sent us\na courier to warn of the false band. In the attack, however, we found the\nHarkonnens had waylaid the Fremen courier\u2014badly wounded him. We were\nbringing him here for treatment by our medics when he died. I\u2019d seen how\nbadly off the man was and stopped to do what I could. I surprised him in the\nattempt to throw something away.\u201d Idaho glanced down at Leto. \u201cA knife,\nm\u2019Lord, a knife the like of which you\u2019ve never seen.\u201d\n\u201cCrysknife?\u201d someone asked.\n\u201cNo doubt of it,\u201d Idaho said. \u201cMilky white and glowing with a light of its\nown like.\u201d He reached into his tunic, brought out a sheath with a black-ridged\nhandle protruding from it.\n\u201cKeep that blade in its sheath!\u201d\nThe voice came from the open door at the end of the room, a vibrant and\npenetrating voice that brought them all up, staring.\nA tall, robed figure stood in the door, barred by the crossed swords of the\nguard. A light tan robe completely enveloped the man except for a gap in the\nhood and black veil that exposed eyes of total blue\u2014no white in them at all.\n\u201cLet him enter,\u201d Idaho whispered.\n\u201cPass that man,\u201d the Duke said.\nThe guards hesitated, then lowered their swords.\nThe man swept into the room, stood across from the Duke.\n\u201cThis is Stilgar, chief of the sietch I visited, leader of those who warned us\nof the false band,\u201d Idaho said.\n\u201cWelcome, sir,\u201d Leto said. \u201cAnd why shouldn\u2019t we unsheath this blade?\u201d\nStilgar glanced at Idaho, said: \u201cYou observed the customs of cleanliness\nand honor among us. I would permit you to see the blade of the man you\nbefriended.\u201d His gaze swept the others in the room. \u201cBut I do not know these\nothers. Would you have them defile an honorable weapon?\u201d\n\u201cI am the Duke Leto,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cWould you permit me to see this\nblade?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll permit you to earn the right to unsheath it,\u201d Stilgar said, and, as a\nmutter of protest sounded around the table, he raised a thin, darkly veined\nhand. \u201cI remind you this is the blade of one who befriended you.\u201d\nIn the waiting silence, Paul studied the man, sensing the aura of power that\nradiated from him. He was a leader\u2014a Fremen leader.\nA man near the center of the table across from Paul muttered: \u201cWho\u2019s he to\ntell us what rights we have on Arrakis?\u201d\n\u201cIt is said that the Duke Leto Atreides rules with the consent of the\ngoverned,\u201d the Fremen said. \u201cThus I must tell you the way it is with us: a\ncertain responsibility falls on those who have seen a crysknife.\u201d He passed a\ndark glance across Idaho. \u201cThey are ours. They may never leave Arrakis\nwithout our consent.\u201d\nHalleck and several of the others started to rise, angry expressions on their\nfaces. Halleck said: \u201cThe Duke Leto determines whether\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne moment, please,\u201d Leto said, and the very mildness of his voice held\nthem. This must not get out of hand, he thought. He addressed himself to the\nFremen: \u201cSir, I honor and respect the personal dignity of any man who\nrespects my dignity. I am indeed indebted to you. And I always pay my debts.\nIf it is your custom that this knife remain sheathed here, then it is so ordered\n\u2014by me. And if there is any other way we may honor the man who died in\nour service, you have but to name it.\u201d\nThe Fremen stared at the Duke, then slowly pulled aside his veil, revealing\na thin nose and full-lipped mouth in a glistening black beard. Deliberately he\nbent over the end of the table, spat on its polished surface.\nAs the men around the table started to surge to their feet, Idaho\u2019s voice\nboomed across the room: \u201cHold!\u201d\nInto the sudden charged stillness, Idaho said: \u201cWe thank you, Stilgar, for\nthe gift of your body\u2019s moisture. We accept it in the spirit with which it is\ngiven.\u201d And Idaho spat on the table in front of the Duke.\nAside to the Duke, he said: \u201cRemember how precious water is here, Sire.\nThat was a token of respect.\u201d\nLeto sank back into his own chair, caught Paul\u2019s eye, a rueful grin on his\nson\u2019s face, sensed the slow relaxation of tension around the table as\nunderstanding came to his men.\nThe Fremen looked at Idaho, said: \u201cYou measured well in my sietch,\nDuncan Idaho. Is there a bond on your allegiance to your Duke?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s asking me to enlist with him, Sire,\u201d Idaho said.\n\u201cWould he accept a dual allegiance?\u201d Leto asked.\n\u201cYou wish me to go with him, Sire?\u201d\n\u201cI wish you to make your own decision in the matter,\u201d Leto said, and he\ncould not keep the urgency out of his voice.\nIdaho studied the Fremen. \u201cWould you have me under these conditions,\nStilgar? There\u2019d be times when I\u2019d have to return to serve my Duke.\u201d\n\u201cYou fight well and you did your best for our friend,\u201d Stilgar said. He\nlooked at Leto. \u201cLet it be thus: the man Idaho keeps the crysknife he holds as\na mark of his allegiance to us. He must be cleansed, of course, and the rites\nobserved, but this can be done. He will be Fremen and soldier of the Atreides.\nThere is precedent for this: Liet serves two masters.\u201d\n\u201cDuncan?\u201d Leto asked.\n\u201cI understand, Sire,\u201d Idaho said.\n\u201cIt is agreed, then,\u201d Leto said.\n\u201cYour water is ours, Duncan Idaho,\u201d Stilgar said. \u201cThe body of our friend\nremains with your Duke. His water is Atreides water. It is a bond between\nus.\u201d\nLeto sighed, glanced at Hawat, catching the old Mentat\u2019s eye. Hawat\nnodded, his expression pleased.\n\u201cI will await below,\u201d Stilgar said, \u201cwhile Idaho makes farewell with his\nfriends. Turok was the name of our dead friend. Remember that when it\ncomes time to release his spirit. You are friends of Turok.\u201d\nStilgar started to turn away.\n\u201cWill you not stay a while?\u201d Leto asked.\nThe Fremen turned back, whipping his veil into place with a casual\ngesture, adjusting something beneath it. Paul glimpsed what looked like a\nthin tube before the veil settled into place.\n\u201cIs there reason to stay?\u201d the Fremen asked.\n\u201cWe would honor you,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cHonor requires that I be elsewhere soon,\u201d the Fremen said. He shot\nanother glance at Idaho, whirled, and strode out past the door guards.\n\u201cIf the other Fremen match him, we\u2019ll serve each other well,\u201d Leto said.\nIdaho spoke in a dry voice: \u201cHe\u2019s a fair sample, Sire.\u201d\n\u201cYou understand what you\u2019re to do, Duncan?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m your ambassador to the Fremen, Sire.\u201d\n\u201cMuch depends on you, Duncan. We\u2019re going to need at least five\nbattalions of those people before the Sardaukar descend on us.\u201d\n\u201cThis is going to take some doing, Sire. The Fremen are a pretty\nindependent bunch.\u201d Idaho hesitated, then: \u201cAnd, Sire, there\u2019s one other\nthing. One of the mercenaries we knocked over was trying to get this blade\nfrom our dead Fremen friend. The mercenary says there\u2019s a Harkonnen\nreward of a million solaris for anyone who\u2019ll bring in a single crysknife.\u201d\nLeto\u2019s chin came up in a movement of obvious surprise. \u201cWhy do they\nwant one of those blades so badly?\u201d\n\u201cThe knife is ground from a sandworm\u2019s tooth; it\u2019s the mark of the\nFremen, Sire. With it, a blue-eyed man could penetrate any sietch in the land.\nThey\u2019d question me unless I were known. I don\u2019t look Fremen. But....\u201d\n\u201cPiter de Vries,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cA man of devilish cunning, my Lord,\u201d Hawat said.\nIdaho slipped the sheathed knife beneath his tunic.\n\u201cGuard that knife,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cI understand, m\u2019Lord.\u201d He patted the transceiver on his belt kit. \u201cI\u2019ll\nreport soon as possible. Thufir has my call code. Use battle language.\u201d He\nsaluted, spun about, and hurried after the Fremen.\nThey heard his footsteps drumming down the corridor.\nA look of understanding passed between Leto and Hawat. They smiled.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve much to do, Sire,\u201d Halleck said.\n\u201cAnd I keep you from your work,\u201d Leto said.\n\u201cI have the report on the advance bases,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cShall I give it\nanother time, Sire?\u201d\n\u201cWill it take long?\u201d\n\u201cNot for a briefing. It\u2019s said among the Fremen that there were more than\ntwo hundred of these advance bases built here on Arrakis during the Desert\nBotanical Testing Station period. All supposedly have been abandoned, but\nthere are reports they were sealed off before being abandoned.\u201d\n\u201cEquipment in them?\u201d the Duke asked.\n\u201cAccording to the reports I have from Duncan.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are they located?\u201d Halleck asked.\n\u201cThe answer to that question,\u201d Hawat said, \u201cis invariably: \u2018Liet knows.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cGod knows,\u201d Leto muttered.\n\u201cPerhaps not, Sire,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cYou heard this Stilgar use the name.\nCould he have been referring to a real person?\u201d\n\u201cServing two masters,\u201d Halleck said. \u201cIt sounds like a religious quotation.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you should know,\u201d the Duke said.\nHalleck smiled.\n\u201cThis Judge of the Change,\u201d Leto said, \u201cthe Imperial ecologist\u2014Kynes....\nWouldn\u2019t he know where those bases are?\u201d\n\u201cSire,\u201d Hawat cautioned, \u201cthis Kynes is an Imperial servant.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s a long way from the Emperor,\u201d Leto said. \u201cI want those bases.\nThey\u2019d be loaded with materials we could salvage and use for repair of our\nworking equipment.\u201d\n\u201cSire!\u201d Hawat said. \u201cThose bases are still legally His Majesty\u2019s fief.\u201d\n\u201cThe weather here\u2019s savage enough to destroy anything,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cWe can always blame the weather. Get this Kynes and at least find out if the\nbases exist.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Twere dangerous to commandeer them,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cDuncan was clear\non one thing: those bases or the idea of them hold some deep significance for\nthe Fremen. We might alienate the Fremen if we took those bases.\u201d\nPaul looked at the faces of the men around them, saw the intensity of the\nway they followed every word. They appeared deeply disturbed by his\nfather\u2019s attitude.\n\u201cListen to him, Father,\u201d Paul said in a low voice. \u201cHe speaks truth.\u201d\n\u201cSire,\u201d Hawat said, \u201cthose bases could give us material to repair every\npiece of equipment left us, yet be beyond reach for strategic reasons. It\u2019d be\nrash to move without greater knowledge. This Kynes has arbiter authority\nfrom the Imperium. We mustn\u2019t forget that. And the Fremen defer to him.\u201d\n\u201cDo it gently, then,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cI wish to know only if those bases\nexist.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will, Sire.\u201d Hawat sat back, lowered his eyes.\n\u201cAll right, then,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cWe know what we have ahead of us\u2014\nwork. We\u2019ve been trained for it. We\u2019ve some experience in it. We know what\nthe rewards are and the alternatives are clear enough. You all have your\nassignments.\u201d He looked at Halleck. \u201cGurney, take care of that smuggler\nsituation first.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018I shall go unto the rebellious that dwell in the dry land,\u2019 \u201d Halleck\nintoned.\n\u201cSomeday I\u2019ll catch that man without a quotation and he\u2019ll look\nundressed,\u201d the Duke said.\nChuckles echoed around the table, but Paul heard the effort in them.\nThe Duke turned to Hawat. \u201cSet up another command post for intelligence\nand communications on this floor, Thufir. When you have them ready, I\u2019ll\nwant to see you.\u201d\nHawat arose, glancing around the room as though seeking support. He\nturned away, led the procession out of the room. The others moved hurriedly,\nscraping their chairs on the floor, balling up in little knots of confusion.\nIt ended up in confusion, Paul thought, staring at the backs of the last men\nto leave. Always before, Staff had ended on an incisive air. This meeting had\njust seemed to trickle out, worn down by its own inadequacies, and with an\nargument to top it off.\nFor the first time, Paul allowed himself to think about the real possibility\nof defeat\u2014not thinking about it out of fear or because of warnings such as\nthat of the old Reverend Mother, but facing up to it because of his own\nassessment of the situation.\nMy father is desperate, he thought. Things aren\u2019t going well for us at all.\nAnd Hawat\u2014Paul recalled how the old Mentat had acted during the\nconference\u2014subtie hesitations, signs of unrest.\nHawat was deeply troubled by something.\n\u201cBest you remain here the rest of the night, Son,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be\ndawn soon, anyway. I\u2019ll inform your mother.\u201d He got to his feet, slowly,\nstiffly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you pull a few of these chairs together and stretch out on\nthem for some rest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not very tired, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will.\u201d\nThe Duke folded his hands behind him, began pacing up and down the\nlength of the table.\nLike a caged animal, Paul thought.\n\u201cAre you going to discuss the traitor possibility with Hawat?\u201d Paul asked.\nThe Duke stopped across from his son, spoke to the dark windows. \u201cWe\u2019ve\ndiscussed the possibility many times.\u201d\n\u201cThe old woman seemed so sure of herself,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd the message\nMother\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPrecautions have been taken,\u201d the Duke said. He looked around the room,\nand Paul marked the hunted wildness in his father\u2019s eyes. \u201cRemain here.\nThere are some things about the command posts I want to discuss with\nThufir.\u201d He turned, strode out of the room, nodding shortly to the door\nguards.\nPaul stared at the place where his father had stood. The space had been\nempty even before the Duke left the room. And he recalled the old woman\u2019s\nwarning: \u201c... for the father, nothing.\u201d\nOn that first day when Muad\u2018Dib rode through the streets of\nArrakeen with his family, some of the people along the way\nrecalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to\nshout: \u201cMahdi!\u201d But their shout was more a question than a\nstatement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one\nforetold as the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World.\nTheir attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they\nhad heard she was a Bene Gesserit and it was obvious to them\nthat she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib.\n\u2014from \u201cManual of Muad\u2019Dib\u201d by the Princess Irulan\nTHE DUKE found Thufir Hawat alone in the corner room to which a\nguard directed him. There was the sound of men setting up communications\nequipment in an adjoining room, but this place was fairly quiet. The Duke\nglanced around as Hawat arose from a paper-cluttered table. It was a green-\nwalled enclosure with, in addition to the table, three suspensor chairs from\nwhich the Harkonnen \u201cH\u201d had been hastily removed, leaving an imperfect\ncolor patch.\n\u201cThe chairs are liberated but quite safe,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cWhere is Paul,\nSire?\u201d\n\u201cI left him in the conference room. I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll get some rest without\nme there to distract him.\u201d\nHawat nodded, crossed to the door to the adjoining room, closed it,\nshutting off the noise of static and electronic sparking.\n\u201cThufir,\u201d Leto said, \u201cthe Imperial and Harkonnen stockpiles of spice attract\nmy attention.\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019Lord?\u201d\nThe Duke pursed his lips. \u201cStorehouses are susceptible to destruction.\u201d He\nraised a hand as Hawat started to speak. \u201cIgnore the Emperor\u2019s hoard. He\u2019d\nsecretly enjoy it if the Harkonnens were embarrassed. And can the Baron\nobject if something is destroyed which he cannot openly admit that he has?\u201d\nHawat shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ve few men to spare, Sire.\u201d\n\u201cUse some of Idaho\u2019s men. And perhaps some of the Fremen would enjoy\na trip off planet. A raid on Giedi Prime\u2014there are tactical advantages to such\na diversion, Thufir.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, my Lord.\u201d Hawat turned away, and the Duke saw evidence of\nnervousness in the old man, thought: Perhaps he suspects I distrust him. He\nmust know I\u2019ve private reports of traitors. Well-best quiet hisfears\nimmediately.\n\u201cThufir,\u201d he said, \u201csince you\u2019re one of the few I can trust completely,\n"
