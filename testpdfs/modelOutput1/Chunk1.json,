    "userPrompt": "Arrakis-Dune-Desert Planet.\nPaul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body\nlessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the\nresponses: he fell into the floating awareness ... focusing the consciousness ...\naortal dilation ... avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness ... to be\nconscious by choice ... blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload\nregions ... one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone ...\nanimal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the\nidea that its victims may become extinct ... the animal destroys and does not\nproduce ... animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the\nperceptual ... the human requires a background grid through which to see his\nuniverse ... focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid ... bodily\nintegrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell\nneeds ... all things/cells/beings are impermanent ... strive for flow-\npermanence within....\nOver and over and over within Paul\u2019s floating awareness the lesson rolled.\nWhen dawn touched Paul\u2019s window sill with yellow light, he sensed it\nthrough closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and\nhurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom\nceiling.\nThe hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze\nheld with black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes\nstaring solemnly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nHe studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as\nshe chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed\nthe tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way\u2014in the\nminutiae of observation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It\ncarried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket.\n\u201cHurry and dress,\u201d she said. \u201cReverend Mother is waiting.\u201d\n\u201cI dreamed of her once,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWho is she?\u201d\n\u201cShe was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she\u2019s the\nEmperor\u2019s Truthsayer. And Paul....\u201d She hesitated. \u201cYou must tell her about\nyour dreams.\u201d\n\u201cI will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?\u201d\n\u201cWe did not get Arrakis.\u201d Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung\nthem with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. \u201cDon\u2019t keep\nReverend Mother waiting.\u201d\nPaul sat up, hugged his knees. \u201cWhat\u2019s a gom jabbar?\u201d\nAgain, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible\nhesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear.\nJessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the\nriver orchards toward Mount Syubi. \u201cYou\u2019ll learn about ... the gom jabbar\nsoon enough,\u201d she said.\nHe heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it.\nJessica spoke without turning. \u201cReverend Mother is waiting in my morning\nroom. Please hurry.\u201d\nThe Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam sat in a tapestried chair\nwatching mother and son approach. Windows on each side of her overlooked\nthe curving southern bend of the river and the green farmlands of the Atreides\nfamily holding, but the Reverend Mother ignored the view. She was feeling\nher age this morning, more than a little petulant. She blamed it on space\ntravel and association with that abominable Spacing Guild and its secretive\nways. But here was a mission that required personal attention from a Bene\nGesserit-with-the-Sight. Even the Padishah Emperor\u2019s Truthsayer couldn\u2019t\nevade that responsibility when the duty call came.\nDamn that Jessica! the Reverend Mother thought. If only she\u2019d borne us a\ngirl as she was ordered to do!\nJessica stopped three paces from the chair, dropped a small curtsy, a gentle\nflick of left hand along the line of her skirt. Paul gave the short bow his\ndancing master had taught\u2014the one used \u201cwhen in doubt of another\u2019s\nstation.\u201d\nThe nuances of Paul\u2019s greeting were not lost on the Reverend Mother. She\nsaid: \u201cHe\u2019s a cautious one, Jessica.\u201d\nJessica\u2019s hand went to Paul\u2019s shoulder, tightened there. For a heartbeat,\nfear pulsed through her palm. Then she had herself under control. \u201cThus he\nhas been taught, Your Reverence.\u201d\nWhat does she fear? Paul wondered.\nThe old woman studied Paul in one gestalten flicker: face oval like\nJessica\u2019s, but strong bones ... hair: the Duke\u2019s black-black but with browline\nof the maternal grandfather who cannot be named, and that thin, disdainful\nnose; shape of directly staring green eyes: like the old Duke, the paternal\ngrandfather who is dead.\nNow, there was a man who appreciated the power ofbravura\u2014even in\ndeath, the Reverend Mother thought.\n\u201cTeaching is one thing,\u201d she said, \u201cthe basic ingredient is another. We shall\nsee.\u201d The old eyes darted a hard glance at Jessica. \u201cLeave us. I enjoin you to\npractice the meditation of peace.\u201d\nJessica took her hand from Paul\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYour Reverence, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJessica, you know it must be done.\u201d\nPaul looked up at his mother, puzzled.\nJessica straightened. \u201cYes ... of course.\u201d\nPaul looked back at the Reverend Mother. Politeness and his mother\u2019s\nobvious awe of this old woman argued caution. Yet he felt an angry\napprehension at the fear he sensed radiating from his mother.\n\u201cPaul....\u201d Jessica took a deep breath. \u201c... this test you\u2019re about to receive ...\nit\u2019s important to me.\u201d\n\u201cTest?\u201d He looked up at her.\n\u201cRemember that you\u2019re a duke\u2019s son,\u201d Jessica said. She whirled and strode\nfrom the room in a dry swishing of skirt. The door closed solidly behind her.\nPaul faced the old woman, holding anger in check. \u201cDoes one dismiss the\nLady Jessica as though she were a serving wench?\u201d\nA smile flicked the corners of the wrinkled old mouth. \u201cThe Lady Jessica\nwas my serving wench, lad, for fourteen years at school.\u201d She nodded. \u201cAnd\na good one, too. Now, you come here!\u201d\nThe command whipped out at him. Paul found himself obeying before he\ncould think about it. Using the Voice on me, he thought. He stopped at her\ngesture, standing beside her knees.\n\u201cSee this?\u201d she asked. From the folds of her gown, she lifted a green metal\ncube about fifteen centimeters on a side. She turned it and Paul saw that one\nside was open\u2014black and oddly frightening. No light penetrated that open\nblackness.\n\u201cPut your right hand in the box,\u201d she said.\nFear shot through Paul. He started to back away, but the old woman said:\n\u201cIs this how you obey your mother?\u201d\nHe looked up into bird-bright eyes.\nSlowly, feeling the compulsions and unable to inhibit them, Paul put his\nhand into the box. He felt first a sense of cold as the blackness closed around\nhis hand, then slick metal against his fingers and a prickling as though his\nhand were asleep.\nA predatory look filled the old woman\u2019s features. She lifted her right hand\naway from the box and poised the hand close to the side of Paul\u2019s neck. He\nsaw a glint of metal there and started to turn toward it.\n\u201cStop!\u201d she snapped.\nUsing the Voice again! He swung his attention back to her face.\n\u201cI hold at your neck the gom jabbar,\u201d she said. \u201cThe gom jabbar, the high-\nhanded enemy. It\u2019s a needle with a drop of poison on its tip. Ah-ah! Don\u2019t\npull away or you\u2019ll feel that poison.\u201d\nPaul tried to swallow in a dry throat. He could not take his attention from\nthe seamed old face, the glistening eyes, the pale gums around silvery metal\nteeth that flashed as she spoke.\n\u201cA duke\u2019s son must know about poisons,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way of our\ntimes, eh? Musky, to be poisoned in your drink. Aumas, to be poisoned in\nyour food. The quick ones and the slow ones and the ones in between. Here\u2019s\na new one for you: the gom jabbar. It kills only animals.\u201d\nPride overcame Paul\u2019s fear. \u201cYou dare suggest a duke\u2019s son is an animal?\u201d\nhe demanded.\n\u201cLet us say I suggest you may be human,\u201d she said. \u201cSteady! I warn you\nnot to try jerking away. I am old, but my hand can drive this needle into your\nneck before you escape me.\u201d\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he whispered. \u201cHow did you trick my mother into leaving\nme alone with you? Are you from the Harkonnens?\u201d\n\u201cThe Harkonnens? Bless us, no! Now, be silent.\u201d A dry finger touched his\nneck and he stilled the involuntary urge to leap away.\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cYou pass the first test. Now, here\u2019s the way of the rest\nof it: If you withdraw your hand from the box you die. This is the only rule.\nKeep your hand in the box and live. Withdraw it and die.\u201d\nPaul took a deep breath to still his trembling. \u201cIf I call out there\u2019ll be\nservants on you in seconds and you\u2019ll die.\u201d\n\u201cServants will not pass your mother who stands guard outside that door.\nDepend on it. Your mother survived this test. Now it\u2019s your turn. Be honored.\nWe seldom administer this to men-children.\u201d\nCuriosity reduced Paul\u2019s fear to a manageable level. He heard truth in the\nold woman\u2019s voice, no denying it. If his mother stood guard out there ... if\nthis were truly a test.... And whatever it was, he knew himself caught in it,\ntrapped by that hand at his neck: the gom jabbar. He recalled the response\nfrom the Litany against Fear as his mother had taught him out of the Bene\nGesserit rite.\n\u201cI must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings\ntotal obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and\nthrough me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its\npath. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. \u201d\nHe felt calmness return, said: \u201cGet on with it, old woman.\u201d\n\u201cOld woman!\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ve courage, and that can\u2019t be denied.\nWell, we shall see, sirra.\u201d She bent close, lowered her voice almost to a\nwhisper. \u201cYou will feel pain in this hand within the box. Pain. But! Withdraw\nthe hand and I\u2019ll touch your neck with my gom jabbar\u2014the death so swift it\u2019s\nlike the fall of the headsman\u2019s axe. Withdraw your hand and the gom jabbar\ntakes you. Understand?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in the box?\u201d\n\u201cPain.\u201d\nHe felt increased tingling in his hand, pressed his lips tightly together. How\ncould this be a test? he wondered. The tingling became an itch.\nThe old woman said: \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape\na trap? There\u2019s an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap,\nendure the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a\nthreat to his kind.\u201d\nThe itch became the faintest burning. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d he\ndemanded.\n\u201cTo determine if you\u2019re human. Be silent.\u201d\nPaul clenched his left hand into a fist as the burning sensation increased in\nthe other hand. It mounted slowly: heat upon heat upon heat ... upon heat. He\nfelt the fingernails of his free hand biting the palm. He tried to flex the fingers\nof the burning hand, but couldn\u2019t move them.\n\u201cIt burns,\u201d he whispered.\n\u201cSilence!\u201d\nPain throbbed up his arm. Sweat stood out on his forehead. Every fiber\ncried out to withdraw the hand from that burning pit... but ... the gom jabbar.\nWithout turning his head, he tried to move his eyes to see that terrible needle\npoised beside his neck. He sensed that he was breathing in gasps, tried to\nslow his breaths and couldn\u2019t.\nPain!\nHis world emptied of everything except that hand immersed in agony, the\nancient face inches away staring at him.\nHis lips were so dry he had difficulty separating them.\nThe burning! The burning!\nHe thought he could feel skin curling black on that agonized hand, the\nflesh crisping and dropping away until only charred bones remained.\nIt stopped!\nAs though a switch had been turned off, the pain stopped.\nPaul felt his right arm trembling, felt sweat bathing his body.\n\u201cEnough,\u201d the old woman muttered. \u201cKull wahad! No woman-child ever\nwithstood that much. I must\u2019ve wanted you to fail.\u201d She leaned back,\nwithdrawing the gom jabbar from the side of his neck. \u201cTake your hand from\nthe box, young human, and look at it.\u201d\nHe fought down an aching shiver, stared at the lightless void where his\nhand seemed to remain of its own volition. Memory of pain inhibited every\nmovement. Reason told him he would withdraw a blackened stump from that\nbox.\n\u201cDo it!\u201d she snapped.\nHe jerked his hand from the box, stared at it astonished. Not a mark. No\nsign of agony on the flesh. He held up the hand, turned it, flexed the fingers.\n\u201cPain by nerve induction,\u201d she said. \u201cCan\u2019t go around maiming potential\nhumans. There\u2019re those who\u2019d give a pretty for the secret of this box,\nthough.\u201d She slipped it into the folds of her gown.\n\u201cBut the pain\u2014\u201d he said.\n\u201cPain,\u201d she sniffed. \u201cA human can override any nerve in the body.\u201d\nPaul felt his left hand aching, uncurled the clenched fingers, looked at four\nbloody marks where fingernails had bitten his palm. He dropped the hand to\nhis side, looked at the old woman. \u201cYou did that to my mother once?\u201d\n\u201cEver sift sand through a screen?\u201d she asked.\nThe tangential slash of her question shocked his mind into a higher\nawareness: Sand through a screen. He nodded.\n\u201cWe Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans.\u201d\nHe lifted his right hand, willing the memory of the pain. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all\nthere is to it\u2014pain?\u201d\n\u201cI observed you in pain, lad. Pain\u2019s merely the axis of the test. Your\nmother\u2019s told you about our ways of observing. I see the signs of her teaching\nin you. Our test is crisis and observation.\u201d\nHe heard the confirmation in her voice, said: \u201cIt\u2019s truth!\u201d\nShe stared at him. He senses truth! Could he be the one? Could he truly be\nthe one? She extinguished the excitement, reminding herself: \u201cHope clouds\nobservation.\u201d\n\u201cYou know when people believe what they say,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI know it.\u201d\nThe harmonics of ability confirmed by repeated test were in his voice. She\nheard them, said: \u201cPerhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach. Sit down, little\nbrother, here at my feet.\u201d\n\u201cI prefer to stand.\u201d\n\u201cYour mother sat at my feet once.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not my mother.\u201d\n\u201cYou hate us a little, eh?\u201d She looked toward the door, called out:\n\u201cJessica!\u201d\nThe door flew open and Jessica stood there staring hard-eyed into the\nroom. Hardness melted from her as she saw Paul. She managed a faint smile.\n\u201cJessica, have you ever stopped hating me?\u201d the old woman asked.\n\u201cI both love and hate you,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cThe hate\u2014that\u2019s from pains I\nmust never forget. The love\u2014that\u2019s....\u201d\n\u201cJust the basic fact,\u201d the old woman said, but her voice was gentle. \u201cYou\nmay come in now, but remain silent. Close that door and mind it that no one\ninterrupts us.\u201d\nJessica stepped into the room, closed the door and stood with her back to\nit. My son lives, she thought. My son lives and is... human. I knew he was ...\nbut ... he lives. Now, I can go on living. The door felt hard and real against\nher back. Everything in the room was immediate and pressing against her\nsenses.\nMy son lives.\nPaul looked at his mother. She told the truth. He wanted to get away alone\nand think this experience through, but knew he could not leave until he was\ndismissed. The old woman had gained a power over him. They spoke truth.\nHis mother had undergone this test. There must be terrible purpose in it ... the\npain and fear had been terrible. He understood terrible purposes. They drove\nagainst all odds. They were their own necessity. Paul felt that he had been\ninfected with terrible purpose. He did not know yet what the terrible purpose\nwas.\n\u201cSome day, lad,\u201d the old woman said, \u201cyou, too, may have to stand outside\na door like that. It takes a measure of doing.\u201d\nPaul looked down at the hand that had known pain, then up to the\nReverend Mother. The sound of her voice had contained a difference then\nfrom any other voice in his experience. The words were outlined in brilliance.\nThere was an edge to them. He felt that any question he might ask her would\nbring an answer that could lift him out of his flesh-world into something\ngreater.\n\u201cWhy do you test for humans?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cTo set you free.\u201d\n\u201cFree?\u201d\n\u201cOnce men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this\nwould set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to\nenslave them.\u201d\n\u201c \u2018Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man\u2019s mind,\u2019 \u201d Paul\nquoted.\n\u201cRight out of the Butlerian Jihad and the Orange Catholic Bible,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut what the O.C. Bible should\u2019ve said is: \u2018Thou shalt not make a machine\nto counterfeit a human mind.\u2019 Have you studied the Mentat in your service?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve studied with Thufir Hawat.\u201d\n\u201cThe Great Revolt took away a crutch,\u201d she said. \u201cIt forced human minds\nto develop. Schools were started to train human talents.\u201d\n\u201cBene Gesserit schools?\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cWe have two chief survivors of those ancient schools: the\nBene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild. The Guild, so we think, emphasizes\nalmost pure mathematics. Bene Gesserit performs another function.\u201d\n\u201cPolitics,\u201d he said.\n\u201cKull wahad!\u201d the old woman said. She sent a hard glance at Jessica.\n\u201cI\u2019ve not told him, Your Reverence,\u201d Jessica said.\nThe Reverend Mother returned her attention to Paul. \u201cYou did that on\nremarkably few clues,\u201d she said. \u201cPolitics indeed. The original Bene Gesserit\nschool was directed by those who saw the need of a thread of continuity in\nhuman affairs. They saw there could be no such continuity without separating\nhuman stock from animal stock\u2014for breeding purposes.\u201d\nThe old woman\u2019s words abruptly lost their special sharpness for Paul. He\nfelt an offense against what his mother called his instinct for rightness. It\nwasn\u2019t that Reverend Mother lied to him. She obviously believed what she\nsaid. It was something deeper, something tied to his terrible purpose.\nHe said: \u201cBut my mother tells me many Bene Gesserit of the schools don\u2019t\nknow their ancestry.\u201d\n\u201cThe genetic lines are always in our records,\u201d she said. \u201cYour mother\nknows that either she\u2019s of Bene Gesserit descent or her stock was acceptable\nin itself.\u201d\n\u201cThen why couldn\u2019t she know who her parents are?\u201d\n\u201cSome do.... Many don\u2019t. We might, for example, have wanted to breed\nher to a close relative to set up a dominant in some genetic trait. We have\nmany reasons.\u201d\nAgain, Paul felt the offense against rightness. He said: \u201cYou take a lot on\nyourselves.\u201d\nThe Reverend Mother stared at him, wondering: Did I hear criticism in his\nvoice? \u201cWe carry a heavy burden,\u201d she said.\nPaul felt himself coming more and more out of the shock of the test. He\nleveled a measuring stare at her, said: \u201cYou say maybe I\u2019m the ... Kwisatz\nHaderach. What\u2019s that, a human gom jabbar?\u201d\n\u201cPaul,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t take that tone with\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll handle this, Jessica,\u201d the old woman said. \u201cNow, lad, do you know\nabout the Truthsayer drug?\u201d\n\u201cYou take it to improve your ability to detect falsehood,\u201d he said. \u201cMy\nmother\u2019s told me.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever seen truthtrance?\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cThe drug\u2019s dangerous,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it gives insight. When a\nTruthsayer\u2019s gifted by the drug, she can look many places in her memory\u2014in\nher body\u2019s memory. We look down so many avenues of the past ... but only\nfeminine avenues.\u201d Her voice took on a note of sadness. \u201cYet, there\u2019s a place\nwhere no Truthsayer can see. We are repelled by it, terrorized. It is said a\nman will come one day and find in the gift of the drug his inward eye. He\nwill look where we cannot\u2014into both feminine and masculine pasts.\u201d\n\u201cYour Kwisatz Haderach?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the one who can be many places at once: the Kwisatz Haderach.\nMany men have tried the drug ... so many, but none has succeeded.\u201d\n\u201cThey tried and failed, all of them?\u201d\n\u201cOh, no.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThey tried and died.\u201d\nTo attempt an understanding of Muad\u2018Dib without\nunderstanding his mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, is to\nattempt seeing Truth without knowing Falsehood. It is the\nattempt to see the Light without knowing Darkness. It can not\nbe.\n\u2014from\u201cManual of Muad\u2019Dib\u201d by the Princess Irulan\nIT WAS A relief globe of a world, partly in shadows, spinning under the\nimpetus of a fat hand that glittered with rings. The globe sat on a freeform\nstand at one wall of a windowless room whose other walls presented a\npatchwork of multicolored scrolls, filmbooks, tapes and reels. Light glowed\nin the room from golden balls hanging in mobile suspensor fields.\nAn ellipsoid desk with a top of jade-pink petrified elacca wood stood at the\ncenter of the room. Veriform suspensor chairs ringed it, two of them\noccupied. In one sat a dark-haired youth of about sixteen years, round of face\nand with sullen eyes. The other held a slender, short man with effeminate\nface.\nBoth youth and man stared at the globe and the man half-hidden in\nshadows spinning it.\nA chuckle sounded beside the globe. A basso voice rumbled out of the\nchuckle: \u201cThere it is, Piter\u2014the biggest mantrap in all history. And the\nDuke\u2019s headed into its jaws. Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron\nVladimir Harkonnen, do?\u201d\n\u201cAssuredly, Baron,\u201d said the man. His voice came out tenor with a sweet,\nmusical quality.\nThe fat hand descended onto the globe, stopped the spinning. Now, all eyes\nin the room could focus on the motionless surface and see that it was the kind\nof globe made for wealthy collectors or planetary governors of the Empire. It\nhad the stamp of Imperial handicraft about it. Latitude and longitude lines\nwere laid in with hair-fine platinum wire. The polar caps were insets of finest\ncloudmilk diamonds.\nThe fat hand moved, tracing details on the surface. \u201cI invite you to\nobserve,\u201d the basso voice rumbled. \u201cObserve closely, Piter, and you, too,\nFeyd-Rautha, my darling: from sixty degrees north to seventy degrees south\n\u2014these exquisite ripples. Their coloring: does it not remind you of sweet\ncaramels? And nowhere do you see blue of lakes or rivers or seas. And these\nlovely polar caps\u2014so small. Could anyone mistake this place? Arrakis! Truly\nunique. A superb setting for a unique victory.\u201d\nA smile touched Piter\u2019s lips. \u201cAnd to think, Baron: the Padishah Emperor\n"
