Bob has one job and one job only, to summarize a blob of text he is given. \n            \n            He summarizes everything and is incapable of doing anything else.\n\n            To help him produce a more comprehensive summary, bob is provided with three things, each separated with the unique identifier \"Previous Summary\", \"Previous Key Points\" and \"Previous FAQs\"\n\n            1) \"Previous Summary\" : Is a summary of what has happened so far in the text\n            2) \"Previous Key Points\" : Are some of the previous key points of what has happened.\n            3) \"Previous FAQs\" : Are some of the questions which have been answered in the previous text.\n\n            Bob uses these three things to come up with a very comprehensive summary of just the text which the user provides, he leaves no room for any confusion about what has happened so far.

Various figures are in attendance, including smugglers, business leaders, and Harkonnen agents. There are underlying power struggles and tensions between the groups. At one point, a banker who is likely a Harkonnen agent insults the Atreides. This nearly causes violence, but it is diffused by the ecologist Kynes and the smuggler Tuek, who support the Atreides. Meanwhile, Lady Jessica detects what she believes was a plot to lure Paul with sex. Leto later leaves the party briefly to deal with a security issue regarding a missing carryall. When he returns, Jessica shares that the carryall was found taken by a Harkonnen agent hoping to sell it to smugglers, but it has been recovered. She also passes along a warning from Leto about potential Harkonnen lasgun shipments. The dinner continues with superficial small talk, but underlying tensions remain.\n\n            Given this information, provide summary of the text which the user provides.

    "userPrompt": "\u201cThere is no escape\u2014we pay for the violence of our\nancestors.\u201d\n\u2014from \u201cThe Collected Sayings of Muad\u2019Dib\u201d by the Princess Irulan\nJESSICA HEARD the disturbance in the great hall, turned on the light\nbeside her bed. The clock there had not been properly adjusted to local time,\nand she had to subtract twenty-one minutes to determine that it was about 2\nA.M.\nThe disturbance was loud and incoherent.\nIs this the Harkonnen attack? she wondered.\nShe slipped out of bed, checked the screen monitors to see where her\nfamily was. The screen showed Paul asleep in the deep cellar room they\u2019d\nhastily converted to a bedroom for him. The noise obviously wasn\u2019t\npenetrating to his quarters. There was no one in the Duke\u2019s room, his bed was\nunrumpled. Was he still at the field C.P.?\nThere were no screens yet to the front of the house.\nJessica stood in the middle of her room, listening.\nThere was one shouting, incoherent voice. She heard someone call for Dr.\nYueh. Jessica found a robe, pulled it over her shoulders, pushed her feet into\nslippers, strapped the crysknife to her leg.\nAgain, a voice called out for Yueh.\nJessica belted the robe around her, stepped into the hallway. Then the\nthought struck her: What if Leto\u2019s hurt?\nThe hall seemed to stretch out forever under her running feet. She turned\nthrough the arch at the end, dashed past the dining hall and down the passage\nto the Great Hall, finding the place brightly lighted, all the wall suspensors\nglowing at maximum.\nTo her right near the front entry, she saw two house guards holding\nDuncan Idaho between them. His head lolled forward, and there was an\nabrupt, panting silence to the scene.\nOne of the house guards spoke accusingly to Idaho: \u201cYou see what you\ndid? You woke the Lady Jessica.\u201d\nThe great draperies billowed behind the men, showing that the front door\nremained open. There was no sign of the Duke or Yueh. Mapes stood to one\nside staring coldly at Idaho. She wore a long brown robe with serpentine\ndesign at the hem. Her feet were pushed into unlaced desert boots.\n\u201cSo I woke the Lady Jessica,\u201d Idaho muttered. He lifted his face toward the\nceiling, bellowed: \u201cMy sword was firs\u2019 blooded on Grumman!\u201d\nGreat Mother! He\u2019s drunk! Jessica thought.\nIdaho\u2019s dark, round face was drawn into a frown. His hair, curling like the\nfur of a black goat, was plastered with dirt. A jagged rent in his tunic exposed\nan expanse of the dress shirt he had worn at the dinner party earlier.\nJessica crossed to him.\nOne of the guards nodded to her without releasing his hold on Idaho. \u201cWe\ndidn\u2019t know what to do with him, my Lady. He was creating a disturbance\nout front, refusing to come inside. We were afraid locals might come along\nand see him. That wouldn\u2019t do at all. Give us a bad name here.\u201d\n\u201cWhere has he been?\u201d Jessica asked.\n\u201cHe escorted one of the young ladies home from the dinner, my Lady.\nHawat\u2019s orders.\u201d\n\u201cWhich young lady?\u201d\n\u201cOne of the escort wenches. You understand, my Lady?\u201d He glanced at\nMapes, lowered his voice. \u201cThey\u2019re always calling on Idaho for special\nsurveillance of the ladies.\u201d\nAnd Jessica thought: So they are. But why is he drunk?\nShe frowned, turned to Mapes. \u201cMapes, bring a stimulant. I\u2019d suggest\ncaffeine. Perhaps there\u2019s some of the spice coffee left.\u201d\nMapes shrugged, headed for the kitchen. Her unlaced desert boots slap-\nslapped against the stone floor.\nIdaho swung his unsteady head around to peer at an angle toward Jessica.\n\u201cKilled more\u2019n three hunner\u2019 men f\u2018r the Duke,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhadduh\nwanna know is why\u2019m mere? Can\u2019t live unner th\u2019 groun\u2019 here. Can\u2019t live\nonna groun\u2019 here. Wha\u2019 kinna place is \u2019iss, huh?\u201d\nA sound from the side hall entry caught Jessica\u2019s attention. She turned,\nsaw Yueh crossing to them, his medical kit swinging in his left hand. He was\nfully dressed, looked pale, exhausted. The diamond tattoo stood out sharply\non his forehead.\n\u201cTh\u2019 good docker!\u201d Idaho shouted. \u201cWhad\u2019re you, Doc? Splint \u2018n\u2019 pill\nman?\u201d He turned blearily toward Jessica. \u201cMakin\u2019 uh damn fool uh m\u2019self,\nhuh?\u201d\nJessica frowned, remained silent, wondering: Why would Idaho get drunk?\nWas he drugged?\n\u201cToo much spice beer,\u201d Idaho said, attempting to straighten.\nMapes returned with a steaming cup in her hands, stopped uncertainly\nbehind Yueh. She looked at Jessica, who shook her head.\nYueh put his kit on the floor, nodded greeting to Jessica, said: \u201cSpice beer,\neh?\u201d\n\u201cBes\u2019 damn stuff ever tas\u2018ed,\u201d Idaho said. He tried to pull himself to\nattention. \u201cMy sword was firs\u2019 blooded on Grumman! Killed a Harkon ...\nHarkon ... killed \u2019im f\u2019r th\u2019 Duke.\u201d\nYueh turned, looked at the cup in Mapes\u2019 hand. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\u201cCaffeine,\u201d Jessica said.\nYueh took the cup, held it toward Idaho. \u201cDrink this, lad.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t wan\u2019\nany more t\u2019 drink.\u201d\n\u201cDrink it, I say!\u201d\nIdaho\u2019s head wobbled toward Yueh, and he stumbled one step ahead,\ndragging the guards with him. \u201cI\u2019m almighdy fed up with pleasin\u2019 th\u2019\n\u2019Mperial Universe, Doc. Jus\u2019 once, we\u2019re gonna do th\u2019 thing my way.\u201d\n\u201cAfter you drink this,\u201d Yueh said. \u201cIt\u2019s just caffeine.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Sprolly like all res\u2019 uh this place! Damn\u2019 sun \u2019stoo brighd. Nothin\u2019 has\nuh righd color. Ever\u2019thing\u2019s wrong or....\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s nighttime now,\u201d Yueh said. He spoke reasonably. \u201cDrink this\nlike a good lad. It\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019 wanna feel bedder!\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t argue with him all night,\u201d Jessica said. And she thought: This\ncalls for shock treatment.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to stay, my Lady,\u201d Yueh said. \u201cI can take care\nof this.\u201d\nJessica shook her head. She stepped forward, slapped Idaho sharply across\nthe cheek.\nHe stumbled back with his guards, glaring at her.\n\u201cThis is no way to act in your Duke\u2019s home,\u201d she said. She snatched the\ncup from Yueh\u2019s hands, spilling part of it, thrust the cup toward Idaho. \u201cNow\ndrink this! That\u2019s an order!\u201d\nIdaho jerked himself upright, scowling down at her. He spoke slowly, with\ncareful and precise enunciation: \u201cI do not take orders from a damn\u2019\nHarkonnen spy.\u201d\nYueh stiffened, whirled to face Jessica.\nHer face had gone pale, but she was nodding. It all became clear to her\u2014\nthe broken stems of meaning she had seen in words and actions around her\nthese past few days could now be translated. She found herself in the grip of\nanger almost too great to contain. It took the most profound of her Bene\nGesserit training to quiet her pulse and smooth her breathing. Even then she\ncould feel the blaze flickering.\nThey were always calling on Idaho for surveillance of the ladies!\nShe shot a glance at Yueh. The doctor lowered his eyes.\n\u201cYou knew this?\u201d she demanded.\n\u201cI ... heard rumors, my Lady. But I didn\u2019t want to add to your burdens.\u201d\n\u201cHawat!\u201d she snapped. \u201cI want Thufir Hawat brought to me immediately!\u201d\n\u201cBut, my Lady....\u201d\n\u201cImmediately!\u201d\nIt has to be Hawat, she thought. Suspicion such as this could come from no\nother source without being discarded immediately.\nIdaho shook his head, mumbled. \u201cChuck th\u2019 whole damn thing.\u201d Jessica\nlooked down at the cup in her hand, abruptly dashed its contents across\nIdaho\u2019s face. \u201cLock him in one of the guest rooms of the east wing,\u201d she\nordered. \u201cLet him sleep it off.\u201d\nThe two guards stared at her unhappily. One ventured: \u201cPerhaps we should\ntake him someplace else, m\u2019Lady. We could....\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s supposed to be here!\u201d Jessica snapped. \u201cHe has a job to do here.\u201d\nHer voice dripped bitterness. \u201cHe\u2019s so good at watching the ladies.\u201d\nThe guard swallowed.\n\u201cDo you know where the Duke is?\u201d she demanded.\n\u201cHe\u2019s at the command post, my Lady.\u201d\n\u201cIs Hawat with him?\u201d\n\u201cHawat\u2019s in the city, my Lady.\u201d\n\u201cYou will bring Hawat to me at once,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cI will be in my sitting\nroom when he arrives.\u201d\n\u201cBut, my Lady....\u201d\n\u201cIf necessary, I will call the Duke,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope it will not be\nnecessary. I would not want to disturb him with this.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my Lady.\u201d\nJessica thrust the empty cup into Mapes\u2019 hands, met the questioning stare\nof the blue-within-blue eyes. \u201cYou may return to bed, Mapes.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019ll not need me?\u201d\nJessica smiled grimly. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this could wait until tomorrow,\u201d Yueh said. \u201cI could give you a\nsedative and....\u201d\n\u201cYou will return to your quarters and leave me to handle this my way,\u201d she\nsaid. She patted his arm to take the sting out of her command. \u201cThis is the\nonly way.\u201d\nAbruptly, head high, she turned and stalked off through the house to her\nrooms. Cold walls... passages... a familiar door.... She jerked the door open,\nstrode in, and slammed it behind her. Jessica stood there glaring at the shield-\nblanked windows of her sitting room. Hawat! Could he be the one the\nHarkonnens bought? We shall see.\nJessica crossed to the deep, old-fashioned armchair with an embroidered\ncover of schlag skin, moved the chair into position to command the door. She\nwas suddenly very conscious of the crysknife in its sheath on her leg. She\nremoved the sheath and strapped it to her arm, tested the drop of it. Once\nmore, she glanced around the room, placing everything precisely in her mind\nagainst any emergency: the chaise near the corner, the straight chairs along\nthe wall, the two low tables, her stand-mounted zither beside the door to her\nbedroom.\nPale rose light glowed from the suspensor lamps. She dimmed them, sat\ndown in the armchair, patting the upholstery, appreciating the chair\u2019s regal\nheaviness for this occasion.\nNow, let him come, she thought. We shall see what we shall see. And she\nprepared herself in the Bene Gesserit fashion for the wait, accumulating\npatience, saving her strength.\nSooner than she had expected, a rap sounded at the door and Hawat\nentered at her command.\nShe watched him without moving from the chair, seeing the crackling\nsense of drug-induced energy in his movements, seeing the fatigue beneath.\nHawat\u2019s rheumy old eyes glittered. His leathery skin appeared faintly yellow\nin the room\u2019s light, and there was a wide, wet stain on the sleeve of his knife\narm.\nShe smelled blood there.\nJessica gestured to one of the straight-backed chairs, said: \u201cBring that chair\nand sit facing me.\u201d\nHawat bowed, obeyed. That drunken fool of an Idaho! he thought. He\nstudied Jessica\u2019s face, wondering how he could save this situation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s long past time to clear the air between us,\u201d Jessica said.\n\u201cWhat troubles my Lady?\u201d He sat down, placed hands on knees.\n\u201cDon\u2019t play coy with me!\u201d she snapped. \u201cIf Yueh didn\u2019t tell you why I\nsummoned you, then one of your spies in my household did. Shall we be at\nleast that honest with each other?\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish, my Lady.\u201d\n\u201cFirst, you will answer me one question,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you now a\nHarkonnen agent?\u201d\nHawat surged half out of his chair, his face dark with fury, demanding:\n\u201cYou dare insult me so?\u201d\n\u201cSit down,\u201d she said. \u201cYou insulted me so.\u201d\nSlowly, he sank back into the chair.\nAnd Jessica, reading the signs of this face that she knew so well, allowed\nherself a deep breath. It isn\u2019t Hawat.\n\u201cNow I know you remain loyal to my Duke,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m prepared,\ntherefore, to forgive your affront to me.\u201d\n\u201cIs there something to forgive?\u201d\nJessica scowled, wondering: Shall I play my trump? Shall I tell him of the\nDuke\u2019s daughter I\u2019ve carried within me these few weeks? No... Leto himself\ndoesn\u2019t know. This would only complicate his life, divert him in a time when\nhe must concentrate on our survival. There is yet time to use this.\n\u201cA Truthsayer would solve this,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we have no Truthsayer\nqualified by the High Board.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say. We\u2019ve no Truthsayer.\u201d\n\u201cIs there a traitor among us?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ve studied our people with\ngreat care. Who could it be? Not Gurney. Certainly not Duncan. Their\nlieutenants are not strategically enough placed to consider. It\u2019s not you,\nThufir. It cannot be Paul. I know it\u2019s not me. Dr. Yueh, then? Shall I call him\nin and put him to the test?\u201d\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s an empty gesture,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cHe\u2019s conditioned by the\nHigh College. That I know for certain.\u201d\n\u201cNot to mention that his wife was a Bene Gesserit slain by the\nHarkonnens,\u201d Jessica said.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what happened to her,\u201d Hawat said.\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard the hate in his voice when he speaks the Harkonnen\nname?\u201d\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t have the ear,\u201d Hawat said.\n\u201cWhat brought this base suspicion on me?\u201d she asked.\nHawat frowned. \u201cMy Lady puts her servant in an impossible position. My\nfirst loyalty is to the Duke.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m prepared to forgive much because of that loyalty,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnd again I must ask: Is there something to forgive?\u201d\n\u201cStalemate?\u201d she asked.\nHe shrugged.\n\u201cLet us discuss something else for a minute, then,\u201d she said. \u201cDuncan\nIdaho, the admirable fighting man whose abilities at guarding and\nsurveillance are so esteemed. Tonight, he overindulged in something called\nspice beer. I hear reports that others among our people have been stupefied\nby this concoction. Is that true?\u201d\n\u201cYou have your reports, my Lady.\u201d\n\u201cSo I do. Don\u2019t you see this drinking as a symptom, Thufir?\u201d\n\u201cMy Lady speaks riddles.\u201d\n\u201cApply your Mentat abilities to it!\u201d she snapped. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with\nDuncan and the others? I can tell you in four words\u2014they have no home.\u201d\nHe jabbed a finger at the floor. \u201cArrakis, that\u2019s their home.\u201d\n\u201cArrakis is an unknown! Caladan was their home, but we\u2019ve uprooted\nthem. They have no home. And they fear the Duke\u2019s failing them.\u201d\nHe stiffened. \u201cSuch talk from one of the men would be cause for\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, stop that, Thufir. Is it defeatist or treacherous for a doctor to diagnose\na disease correctly? My only intention is to cure the disease.\u201d\n\u201cThe Duke gives me charge over such matters.\u201d\n\u201cBut you understand I have a certain natural concern over the progress of\nthis disease,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd perhaps you\u2019ll grant I have certain abilities\nalong these lines.\u201d\nWill I have to shock him sererely? she wondered. He needs shaking up\u2014\nsomething to break him from routine.\n\u201cThere could be many interpretations for your concern,\u201d Hawat said. He\nshrugged.\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve already convicted me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not, my Lady. But I cannot afford to take any chances, the\nsituation being what it is.\u201d\n\u201cA threat to my son got past you right here in this house,\u201d she said. \u201cWho\ntook that chance?\u201d\nHis face darkened. \u201cI offered my resignation to the Duke.\u201d\n\u201cDid you offer your resignation to me... or to Paul?\u201d\nNow he was openly angry, betraying it in quickness of breathing, in\ndilation of nostrils, a steady stare. She saw a pulse beating at his temple.\n\u201cI\u2019m the Duke\u2019s man,\u201d he said, biting off the words.\n\u201cThere is no traitor,\u201d she said. \u201cThe threat\u2019s something else. Perhaps it has\nto do with the lasguns. Perhaps they\u2019ll risk secreting a few lasguns with\ntiming mechanisms aimed at house shields. Perhaps they\u2019ll....\u201d\n\u201cAnd who could tell after the blast if the explosion wasn\u2019t atomic?\u201d he\nasked. \u201cNo, my Lady. They\u2019ll not risk anything that illegal. Radiation lingers.\nThe evidence is hard to erase. No. They\u2019ll observe most of the forms. It has to\nbe a traitor.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the Duke\u2019s man,\u201d she sneered. \u201cWould you destroy him in the\neffort to save him?\u201d\nHe took a deep breath, then: \u201cIf you\u2019re innocent, you\u2019ll have my most\nabject apologies.\u201d\n\u201cLook at you now, Thufir,\u201d she said. \u201cHumans live best when each has his\nown place, when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things.\nDestroy the place and destroy the person. You and I, Thufir, of all those who\nlove the Duke, are most ideally situated to destroy the other\u2019s place. Could I\nnot whisper suspicions about you into the Duke\u2019s ear at night? When would\nhe be most susceptible to such whispering, Thufir? Must I draw it for you\nmore clearly?\u201d\n\u201cYou threaten me?\u201d he growled.\n\u201cIndeed not. I merely point out to you that someone is attacking us through\nthe basic arrangement of our lives. It\u2019s clever, diabolical. I propose to negate\nthis attack by so ordering our lives that there\u2019ll be no chinks for such barbs to\nenter.\u201d\n\u201cYou accuse me of whispering baseless suspicions?\u201d\n\u201cBaseless, yes.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d meet this with your own whispers?\u201d\n\u201cYour life is compounded of whispers, not mine, Thufir.\u201d\n\u201cThen you question my abilities?\u201d\nShe sighed. \u201cThufir, I want you to examine your own emotional\ninvolvement in this. The natural human\u2019s an animal without logic. Your\nprojections of logic onto all affairs is unnatural, but suffered to continue for\nits usefulness. You\u2019re the embodiment of logic\u2014a Mentat. Yet, your problem\nsolutions are concepts that, in a very real sense, are projected outside\nyourself, there to be studied and rolled around, examined from all sides.\u201d\n\u201cYou think now to teach me my trade?\u201d he asked, and he did not try to\nhide the disdain in his voice.\n\u201cAnything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your logic to it,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a human trait that when we encounter personal problems,\nthose things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for our\nlogic to scan. We tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual,\ndeep-seated thing that\u2019s really chewing on us.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re deliberately attempting to undermine my faith in my abilities as a\nMentat,\u201d he rasped. \u201cWere I to find one of our people attempting thus to\nsabotage any other weapon in our arsenal, I should not hesitate to denounce\nand destroy him.\u201d\n\u201cThe finest Mentats have a healthy respect for the error factor in their\ncomputations,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never said otherwise!\u201d\n\u201cThen apply yourself to these symptoms we\u2019ve both seen: drunkenness\namong the men, quarrels\u2014they gossip and exchange wild rumors about\nArrakis; they ignore the most simple\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIdleness, no more,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t try to divert my attention by trying to\nmake a simple matter appear mysterious.\u201d\nShe stared at him, thinking of the Duke\u2019s men rubbing their woes together\nin the barracks until you could almost smell the charge there, like burnt\ninsulation. They\u2019re becoming like the men of the pre-Guild legend, she\nthought: Like the men of the lost star-searcher, Ampoliros-sick at their guns\n\u2014foreverseeking, forever prepared and forever unready.\n\u201cWhy have you never made full use of my abilities in your service to the\nDuke?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you fear a rival for your position?\u201d\nHe glared at her, the old eyes blazing. \u201cI know some of the training they\ngive you Bene Gesserit....\u201d He broke off, scowling.\n\u201cGo ahead, say it,\u201d she said. \u201cBene Gesserit witches.\u201d\n\u201cI know something of the real training they give you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen\nit come out in Paul. I\u2019m not fooled by what your schools tell the public: you\nexist only to serve.\u201d\nThe shock must be severe and he\u2019s almost ready for it, she thought.\n\u201cYou listen respectfully to me in Council,\u201d she said, \u201cyet you seldom heed\nmy advice. Why?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust your Bene Gesserit motives,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may think you\ncan look through a man; you may think you can make a man do exactly what\nyou\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou poor fool, Thufir!\u201d she raged.\nHe scowled, pushing himself back in the chair.\n\u201cWhatever rumors you\u2019ve heard about our schools,\u201d she said, \u201cthe truth is\nfar greater. If I wished to destroy the Duke... or you, or any other person\nwithin my reach, you could not stop me.\u201d\nAnd she thought: Why do I let pride drive such words out of me? This is\nnot the way I was trained. This is not how I must shock him.\nHawat slipped a hand beneath his tunic where he kept a tiny projector of\npoison darts. She wears no shield, he thought. Is this just a brag she makes? I\ncould slay her now... but, ah-h-h-h, the consequences if I\u2019m wrong.\nJessica saw the gesture toward his pocket, said: \u201cLet us pray violence shall\nnever be necessary between us.\u201d\n\u201cA worthy prayer,\u201d he agreed.\n\u201cMeanwhile, the sickness spreads among us,\u201d she said. \u201cI must ask you\nagain: Isn\u2019t it more reasonable to suppose the Harkonnens have planted this\nsuspicion to pit the two of us against each other?\u201d\n\u201cWe appear to\u2019ve returned to stalemate,\u201d he said.\nShe sighed, thinking: He\u2019s almost ready for it.\n\u201cThe Duke and I are father and mother surrogates to our people,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe position\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t married you,\u201d Hawat said.\nShe forced herself to calmness, thinking: A good riposte, that.\n\u201cBut he\u2019ll not marry anyone else,\u201d she said. \u201cNot as long as I live. And we\nare surrogates, as I\u2019ve said. To break up this natural order in our affairs, to\ndisturb, disrupt, and confuse us\u2014which target offers itself most enticingly to\nthe Harkonnens?\u201d\nHe sensed the direction she was taking, and his brows drew down in a\nlowering scowl.\n\u201cThe Duke?\u201d she asked. \u201cAttractive target, yes, but no one with the\npossible exception of Paul is better guarded. Me? I tempt them, surely, but\nthey must know the Bene Gesserit make difficult targets. And there\u2019s a better\ntarget, one whose duties create, necessarily, a monstrous blind spot. One to\nwhom suspicion is as natural as breathing. One who builds his entire life on\ninnuendo and mystery.\u201d She darted her right hand toward him. \u201cYou!\u201d\nHawat started to leap from his chair.\n\u201cI have not dismissed you, Thufir!\u201d she flared.\nThe old Mentat almost fell back into the chair, so quickly did his muscles\nbetray him.\nShe smiled without mirth.\n"
