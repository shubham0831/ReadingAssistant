    "userPrompt": "Hawat turned, standing in the open doorway.\n\u201cDon\u2019t sit with your back to any doors,\u201d Paul said.\nA grin spread across the seamed old face. \u201cThat I won\u2019t, lad. Depend on\nit.\u201d And he was gone, shutting the door softly behind.\nPaul sat down where Hawat had been, straightened the papers. One more\nday here, he thought. He looked around the room. We\u2019re leaving. The idea of\ndeparture was suddenly more real to him than it had ever been before. He\nrecalled another thing the old woman had said about a world being the sum of\nmany things\u2014the people, the dirt, the growing things, the moons, the tides,\nthe suns\u2014the unknown sum called nature, a vague summation without any\nsense of the now. And he wondered: What is the now?\nThe door across from Paul banged open and an ugly lump of a man lurched\nthrough it preceded by a handful of weapons.\n\u201cWell, Gurney Halleck,\u201d Paul called, \u201care you the new weapons master?\u201d\nHalleck kicked the door shut with one heel. \u201cYou\u2019d rather I came to play\ngames, I know,\u201d he said. He glanced around the room, noting that Hawat\u2019s\nmen already had been over it, checking, making it safe for a duke\u2019s heir. The\nsubtle code signs were all around.\nPaul watched the rolling, ugly man set himself back in motion, veer toward\nthe training table with the load of weapons, saw the nine-string baliset slung\nover Gurney\u2019s shoulder with the multipick woven through the strings near the\nhead of the fingerboard.\nHalleck dropped the weapons on the exercise table, lined them up\u2014the\nrapiers, the bodkins, the kindjals, the slow-pellet stunners, the shield belts.\nThe inkvine scar along his jawline writhed as he turned, casting a smile\nacross the room.\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t even have a good morning for me, you young imp,\u201d Halleck\nsaid. \u201cAnd what barb did you sink in old Hawat? He passed me in the hall\nlike a man running to his enemy\u2019s funeral.\u201d\nPaul grinned. Of all his father\u2019s men, he liked Gurney Halleck best, knew\nthe man\u2019s moods and deviltry, his humors, and thought of him more as a\nfriend than as a hired sword.\nHalleck swung the baliset off his shoulder, began tuning it. \u201cIf y\u2019 won\u2019t\ntalk, y\u2019 won\u2019t,\u201d he said.\nPaul stood, advanced across the room, calling out: \u201cWell, Gurney, do we\ncome prepared for music when it\u2019s fighting time?\u201d\n\u201cSo it\u2019s sass for our elders today,\u201d Halleck said. He tried a chord on the\ninstrument, nodded.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Duncan Idaho?\u201d Paul asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t he supposed to be teaching\nme weaponry?\u201d\n\u201cDuncan\u2019s gone to lead the second wave onto Arrakis,\u201d Halleck said. \u201cAll\nyou have left is poor Gurney who\u2019s fresh out of fight and spoiling for music.\u201d\nHe struck another chord, listened to it, smiled.\n\u201cAnd it was decided in council that you being such a poor fighter we\u2019d\nbest teach you the music trade so\u2019s you won\u2019t waste your life entire.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019d better sing me a lay then,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI want to be sure how\nnot to do it.\u201d\n\u201cAh-h-h, hah!\u201d Gurney laughed, and he swung into \u201cGalacian Girls,\u201d his\nmultipick a blur over the strings as he sang:\n\u201cOh-h-h, the Galacian girls \nWill do it for pearls, \nAnd the Arrakeen for water! \nBut if you desire dames \nLike consuming flames, \nTry a Caladanin daughter!\u201d\n\u201cNot bad for such a poor hand with the pick,\u201d Paul said, \u201cbut if my mother\nheard you singing a bawdy like that in the castle, she\u2019d have your ears on the\nouter wall for decoration.\u201d\nGurney pulled at his left ear. \u201cPoor decoration, too, they having been\nbruised so much listening at keyholes while a young lad I know practiced\nsome strange ditties on his baliset.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve forgotten what it\u2019s like to find sand in your bed,\u201d Paul said. He\npulled a shield belt from the table, buckled it fast around his waist. \u201cThen,\nlet\u2019s fight!\u201d\nHalleck\u2019s eyes went wide in mock surprise. \u201cSo! It was your wicked hand\ndid that deed! Guard yourself today, young master\u2014guard yourself.\u201d He\ngrabbed up a rapier, laced the air with it. \u201cI\u2019m a hellfiend out for revenge!\u201d\nPaul lifted the companion rapier, bent it in his hands, stood in the aguile,\none foot forward. He let his manner go solemn in a comic imitation of Dr.\nYueh.\n\u201cWhat a dolt my father sends me for weaponry,\u201d Paul intoned. \u201cThis\ndoltish Gurney Halleck has forgotten the first lesson for a fighting man armed\nand shielded.\u201d Paul snapped the force button at his waist, felt the crinkled-\nskin tingling of the defensive field at his forehead and down his back, heard\nexternal sounds take on characteristic shield-filtered flatness. \u201cIn shield\nfighting, one moves fast on defense, slow on attack,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAttack has\nthe sole purpose of tricking the opponent into a misstep, setting him up for\nthe attack sinister. The shield turns the fast blow, admits the slow kindjal!\u201d\nPaul snapped up the rapier, feinted fast and whipped it back for a slow thrust\ntimed to enter a shield\u2019s mindless defenses.\nHalleck watched the action, turned at the last minute to let the blunted\nblade pass his chest. \u201cSpeed, excellent,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you were wide open\nfor an underhanded counter with a slip-tip.\u201d\nPaul stepped back, chagrined.\n\u201cI should whap your backside for such carelessness,\u201d Halleck said. He\nlifted a naked kindjal from the table and held it up. \u201cThis in the hand of an\nenemy can let out your life\u2019s blood! You\u2019re an apt pupil, none better, but I\u2019ve\nwarned you that not even in play do you let a man inside your guard with\ndeath in his hand.\u201d\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m not in the mood for it today,\u201d Paul said.\n\u201cMood?\u201d Halleck\u2019s voice betrayed his outrage even through the shield\u2019s\nfiltering. \u201cWhat has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises\n\u2014no matter the mood! Mood\u2019s a thing for cattle or making love or playing\nthe baliset. It\u2019s not for fighting.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gurney.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sorry enough!\u201d\nHalleck activated his own shield, crouched with kindjal outthrust in left\nhand, the rapier poised high in his right. \u201cNow I say guard yourself for true!\u201d\nHe leaped high to one side, then forward, pressing a furious attack.\nPaul fell back, parrying. He felt the field crackling as shield edges touched\nand repelled each other, sensed the electric tingling of the contact along his\nskin. What\u2019s gotten into Gurney? he asked himself. He\u2019s not faking this! Paul\nmoved his left hand, dropped his bodkin into his palm from its wrist sheath.\n\u201cYou see a need for an extra blade, eh?\u201d Halleck grunted.\nIs this betrayal? Paul wondered. Surely not Gurney!\nAround the room they fought\u2014thrust and parry, feint and counter-feint.\nThe air within their shield bubbles grew stale from the demands on it that the\nslow interchange along barrier edges could not replenish. With each new\nshield contact, the smell of ozone grew stronger.\nPaul continued to back, but now he directed his retreat toward the exercise\ntable. If I can turn him beside the table, I\u2019ll show him a trick, Paul thought.\nOne more step, Gurney.\nHalleck took the step.\nPaul directed a parry downward, turned, saw Halleck\u2019s rapier catch against\nthe table\u2019s edge. Paul flung himself aside, thrust high with rapier and came in\nacross Halleck\u2019s neckline with the bodkin. He stopped the blade an inch from\nthe jugular.\n\u201cIs this what you seek?\u201d Paul whispered.\n\u201cLook down, lad,\u201d Gurney panted.\nPaul obeyed, saw Halleck\u2019s kindjal thrust under the table\u2019s edge, the tip\nalmost touching Paul\u2019s groin.\n\u201cWe\u2019d have joined each other in death,\u201d Halleck said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll admit you\nfought some better when pressed to it. You seemed to get the mood.\u201d And he\ngrinned wolfishly, the inkvine scar rippling along his jaw.\n\u201cThe way you came at me,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWould you really have drawn my\nblood?\u201d\nHalleck withdrew the kindjal, straightened. \u201cIf you\u2019d fought one whit\nbeneath your abilities, I\u2019d have scratched you a good one, a scar you\u2019d\nremember. I\u2019ll not have my favorite pupil fall to the first Harkonnen tramp\nwho happens along.\u201d\nPaul deactivated his shield, leaned on the table to catch his breath. \u201cI\ndeserved that, Gurney. But it would\u2019ve angered my father if you\u2019d hurt me.\nI\u2019ll not have you punished for my failing.\u201d\n\u201cAs to that,\u201d Halleck said, \u201cit was my failing, too. And you needn\u2019t worry\nabout a training scar or two. You\u2019re lucky you have so few. As to your father\n\u2014the Duke\u2019d punish me only if I failed to make a first-class fighting man out\nof you. And I\u2019d have been failing there if I hadn\u2019t explained the fallacy in this\nmood thing you\u2019ve suddenly developed.\u201d\nPaul straightened, slipped his bodkin back into its wrist sheath.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly play we do here,\u201d Halleck said.\nPaul nodded. He felt a sense of wonder at the uncharacteristic seriousness\nin Halleck\u2019s manner, the sobering intensity. He looked at the beet-colored\ninkvine scar on the man\u2019s jaw, remembering the story of how it had been put\nthere by Beast Rabban in a Harkonnen slave pit on Giedi Prime. And Paul\nfelt a sudden shame that he had doubted Halleck even for an instant. It\noccurred to Paul, then, that the making of Halleck\u2019s scar had been\naccompanied by pain\u2014a pain as intense, perhaps, as that inflicted by a\nReverend Mother. He thrust this thought aside; it chilled their world.\n\u201cI guess I did hope for some play today,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThings are so serious\naround here lately.\u201d\nHalleck turned away to hide his emotions. Something burned in his eyes.\nThere was pain in him\u2014like a blister, all that was left of some lost yesterday\nthat Time had pruned off him.\nHow soon this child must assume his manhood, Halleck thought. How soon\nhe must read that form within his mind, that contract of brutal caution, to\nenter the necessary fact on the necessary line: \u201cPlease list your next of kin. \u201d\nHalleck spoke without turning: \u201cI sensed the play in you, lad, and I\u2019d like\nnothing better than to join in it. But this no longer can be play. Tomorrow we\ngo to Arrakis. Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.\u201d\nPaul touched his forehead with his rapier blade held vertical.\nHalleck turned, saw the salute and acknowledged it with a nod. He\ngestured to the practice dummy. \u201cNow, we\u2019ll work on your timing. Let me\nsee you catch that thing sinister. I\u2019ll control it from over here where I can\nhave a full view of the action. And I warn you I\u2019ll be trying new counters\ntoday. There\u2019s a warning you\u2019d not get from a real enemy.\u201d\nPaul stretched up on his toes to relieve his muscles. He felt solemn with the\nsudden realization that his life had become filled with swift changes. He\ncrossed to the dummy, slapped the switch on its chest with his rapier tip and\nfelt the defensive field forcing his blade away.\n\u201cEn garde!\u201d Halleck called, and the dummy pressed the attack.\nPaul activated his shield, parried and countered.\nHalleck watched as he manipulated the controls. His mind seemed to be in\ntwo parts: one alert to the needs of the training fight, and the other wandering\nin fly-buzz.\nI\u2019m the well-trained fruit tree, he thought. Full of well-trained feelings and\nabilities and all of them grafted onto me-all bearing for someone else to pick.\nFor some reason, he recalled his younger sister, her elfin face so clear in\nhis mind. But she was dead now\u2014in a pleasure house for Harkonnen troops.\nShe had loved pansies ... or was it daisies? He couldn\u2019t remember. It bothered\nhim that he couldn\u2019t remember.\nPaul countered a slow swing of the dummy, brought up his left hand\nentretisser.\nThe clever little devil! Halleck thought, intent now on Paul\u2019s interweaving\nhand motions. He\u2019s been practicing and studying on his own. That\u2019s not\nDuncan style, and it\u2019s certainly nothing I\u2019ve taught him.\nThis thought only added to Halleck\u2019s sadness. I\u2019m infected by mood, he\nthought. And he began to wonder about Paul, if the boy ever listened\nfearfully to his pillow throbbing in the night.\n\u201cIf wishes were fishes we\u2019d all cast nets,\u201d he murmured.\nIt was his mother\u2019s expression and he always used it when he felt the\nblackness of tomorrow on him. Then he thought what an odd expression that\nwas to be taking to a planet that had never known seas or fishes.\nYUEH (ya\u2019\u0113), Wellington (weling- tun), Stdrd 10,082-10,\n191; medical doctor of the Suk School (grd Stdrd 10, 112); md:\nWannaMarcus, B. G. (Stdrd 10,092-10,186?); chiefly noted as\nbetrayer of Duke Leto Atreides.(Cf: Bibliography, Appendix VII\nImperial Conditioning and Betrayal, The.)\n\u2014from\u201cDictionary of Muad\u2019Dib\u201d by the Princess Irulan\nALTHOUGH HE heard Dr. Yueh enter the training room, noting the stiff\ndeliberation of the man\u2019s pace, Paul remained stretched out face down on the\nexercise table where the masseuse had left him. He felt deliciously relaxed\nafter the workout with Gurney Halleck.\n\u201cYou do look comfortable,\u201d said Yueh in his calm, high-pitched voice.\nPaul raised his head, saw the man\u2019s stick figure standing several paces\naway, took in at a glance the wrinkled black clothing, the square block of a\nhead with purple lips and drooping mustache, the diamond tattoo of Imperial\nConditioning on his forehead, the long black hair caught in the Suk School\u2019s\nsilver ring at the left shoulder.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be happy to hear we haven\u2019t time for regular lessons today,\u201d Yueh\nsaid. \u201cYour father will be along presently.\u201d\nPaul sat up.\n\u201cHowever, I\u2019ve arranged for you to have a filmbook viewer and several\nlessons during the crossing to Arrakis.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nPaul began pulling on his clothes. He felt excitement that his father would\nbe coming. They had spent so little time together since the Emperor\u2019s\ncommand to take over the fief of Arrakis.\nYueh crossed to the ell table, thinking: How the boy has filled out these\npast few months. Such a waste! Oh, such a sad waste. And he reminded\nhimself: I must not falter. What I do is done to be certain my Wanna no\nlonger can be hurt by the Harkonnen beasts.\nPaul joined him at the table, buttoning his jacket. \u201cWhat\u2019ll I be studying on\nthe way across?\u201d\n\u201cAh-h-h, the terranic life forms of Arrakis. The planet seems to have\nopened its arms to certain terranic life forms. It\u2019s not clear how. I must seek\nout the planetary ecologist when we arrive\u2014a Dr. Kynes\u2014and offer my help\nin the investigation.\u201d\nAnd Yueh thought: What am I saying? I play the hypocrite even with\nmyself.\n\u201cWill there be something on the Fremen?\u201d Paul asked.\n\u201cThe Fremen?\u201d Yueh drummed his fingers on the table, caught Paul\nstaring at the nervous motion, withdrew his hand.\n\u201cMaybe you have something on the whole Arrakeen population,\u201d Paul\nsaid.\n\u201cYes, to be sure,\u201d Yueh said. \u201cThere are two general separations of the\npeople\u2014Fremen, they are one group, and the others are the people of the\ngraben, the sink, and the pan. There\u2019s some intermarriage, I\u2019m told. The\nwomen of pan and sink villages prefer Fremen husbands; their men prefer\nFremen wives. They have a saying: \u2018Polish comes from the cities; wisdom\nfrom the desert.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cDo you have pictures of them?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can get you. The most interesting feature, of course, is their\neyes\u2014totally blue, no whites in them.\u201d\n\u201cMutation?\u201d\n\u201cNo; it\u2019s linked to saturation of the blood with melange.\u201d\n\u201cThe Fremen must be brave to live at the edge of that desert.\u201d\n\u201cBy all accounts,\u201d Yueh said. \u201cThey compose poems to their knives. Their\nwomen are as fierce as the men. Even Fremen children are violent and\ndangerous. You\u2019ll not be permitted to mingle with them, I daresay.\u201d\nPaul stared at Yueh, finding in these few glimpses of the Fremen a power\nof words that caught his entire attention. What a people to win as allies!\n\u201cAnd the worms?\u201d Paul asked.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to study more about the sandworms.\u201d\n\u201cAh-h-h, to be sure. I\u2019ve a filmbook on a small specimen, only one\nhundred and ten meters long and twenty-two meters in diameter. It was taken\nin the northern latitudes. Worms of more than four hundred meters in length\nhave been recorded by reliable witnesses, and there\u2019s reason to believe even\nlarger ones exist.\u201d\nPaul glanced down at a conical projection chart of the northern Arrakeen\nlatitudes spread on the table. \u201cThe desert belt and south polar regions are\nmarked uninhabitable. Is it the worms?\u201d\n\u201cAnd the storms.\u201d\n\u201cBut any place can be made habitable.\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s economically feasible,\u201d Yueh said. \u201cArrakis has many costly\nperils.\u201d He smoothed his drooping mustache. \u201cYour father will be here soon.\nBefore I go, I\u2019ve a gift for you, something I came across in packing.\u201d He put\nan object on the table between them\u2014black, oblong, no larger than the end of\nPaul\u2019s thumb.\nPaul looked at it. Yueh noted how the boy did not reach for it, and thought:\nHow cautious he is.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very old Orange Catholic Bible made for space travelers. Not a\nfilmbook, but actually printed on filament paper. It has its own magnifier and\nelectrostatic charge system.\u201d He picked it up, demonstrated. \u201cThe book is\nheld closed by the charge, which forces against spring-locked covers. You\npress the edge\u2014thus, and the pages you\u2019ve selected repel each other and the\nbook opens.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s so small.\u201d\n\u201cBut it has eighteen hundred pages. You press the edge\u2014thus, and so ...\nand the charge moves ahead one page at a time as you read. Never touch the\nactual pages with your fingers. The filament tissue is too delicate.\u201d He closed\nthe book, handed it to Paul. \u201cTry it.\u201d\nYueh watched Paul work the page adjustment, thought: I salve my own\nconscience. I give him the surcease of religion before betraying him. Thus\nmay I say to myself that he has gone where I cannot go.\n\u201cThis must\u2019ve been made before filmbooks,\u201d Paul said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite old. Let it be our secret, eh? Your parents might think it too\nvaluable for one so young.\u201d\nAnd Yueh thought: His mother would surely wonder at my motives.\n\u201cWell....\u201d Paul closed the book, held it in his hand. \u201cIf it\u2019s so valuable....\u201d\n\u201cIndulge an old man\u2019s whim,\u201d Yueh said. \u201cIt was given to me when I was\nvery young.\u201d And he thought: I must catch his mind as well as his cupidity.\n\u201cOpen it to four-sixty-seven K\u201d alima\u2014where it says: \u2018From water does all\nlife begin.\u2019 There\u2019s a slight notch on the edge of the cover to mark the place.\u201d\nPaul felt the cover, detected two notches, one shallower than the other. He\npressed the shallower one and the book spread open on his palm, its\nmagnifier sliding into place.\n\u201cRead it aloud,\u201d Yueh said.\nPaul wet his lips with his tongue, read: \u2018Think you of the fact that a deaf\nperson cannot hear. Then, what deafness may we not all possess? What\nsenses do we lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world all\naround us? What is there around us that we cannot\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStop it!\u201d Yueh barked.\nPaul broke off, stared at him.\nYueh closed his eyes, fought to regain composure. What perversity caused\nthe book to open at my Wanna\u2019s favorite passage? He opened his eyes, saw\nPaul staring at him.\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Paul asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Yueh said. \u201cThat was ... my ... dead wife\u2019s favorite passage.\nIt\u2019s not the one I intended you to read. It brings up memories that are ...\npainful.\u201d\n\u201cThere are two notches,\u201d Paul said.\nOf course, Yueh thought. Wanna marked her passage. His fingers are\nmore sensitive than mine andfoundher mark. It was an accident, no more.\n\u201cYou may find the book interesting,\u201d Yueh said. \u201cIt has much historical\ntruth in it as well as good ethical philosophy.\u201d\nPaul looked down at the tiny book in his palm\u2014such a small thing. Yet, it\ncontained a mystery ... something had happened while he read from it. He\nhad felt something stir his terrible purpose.\n\u201cYour father will be here any minute,\u201d Yueh said. \u201cPut the book away and\nread it at your leisure.\u201d\nPaul touched the edge of it as Yueh had shown him. The book sealed itself.\nHe slipped it into his tunic. For a moment there when Yueh had barked at\nhim, Paul had feared the man would demand the book\u2019s return.\n\u201cI thank you for the gift, Dr. Yueh,\u201d Paul said, speaking formally. \u201cIt will\nbe our secret. If there is a gift of favor you wish from me, please do not\nhesitate to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI ... need for nothing,\u201d Yueh said.\nAnd he thought: Why do I stand here torturing myself? And torturing this\npoor lad ... though he does not know it. Oeyh! Damn those Harkonnen\nbeasts! Why did they choose mefortheir abomination?\n"
