This every sister of the Bene Gesseritknows. To begin your study of the life of Muad\u00e2Dib, then, takecare that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th yearof the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the mostspecial care that you locate Muad\u00e2Dib in his place: the planetArrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was bom onCaladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, theplanet known as Dune, is forever his place.-from \u00e2Manual of Muad\u00e2Dib\u00e2 by the Princess IrulanIN THE week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the finalscurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came tovisit the mother of the boy, Paul.It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone thathad served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore thatcooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather.The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage byPaul\u00e2s room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay inhis bed.By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor,the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing onestep ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow\u00e2hair likematted spiderwebs, hooded \u00e2round darkness of features, eyes like glitteringjewels.\u00e2Is he not small for his age, Jessica?\u00e2 the old woman asked. Her voicewheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset.Paul\u00e2s mother answered in her soft contralto: \u00e2The Atreides are known tostart late getting their growth, Your Reverence.\u00e2\u00e2So I\u00e2ve heard, so I\u00e2ve heard,\u00e2 wheezed the old woman. \u00e2Yet he\u00e2s alreadyfifteen.\u00e2\u00e2Yes, Your Reverence.\u00e2\u00e2He\u00e2s awake and listening to us,\u00e2 said the old woman. \u00e2Sly little rascal.\u00e2She chuckled. \u00e2But royalty has need of slyness. And if he\u00e2s really theKwisatz Haderach ... well....\u00e2Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Twobird-bright ovals\u00e2the eyes of the old woman\u00e2seemed to expand and glowas they stared into his.\u00e2Sleep well, you sly little rascal,\u00e2 said the old woman. \u00e2Tomorrow you\u00e2llneed all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.\u00e2And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solidthump.Paul lay awake wondering: What\u00e2s a gom jabbar?In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangestthing he had seen.Your Reverence.And the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wenchinstead of what she was\u00e2a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke\u00e2s concubine andmother of the ducal heir.Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? hewondered.He mouthed her strange words: Gomjabbar... Kwisatz Haderach.There had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place sodifferent from Caladan that Paul\u00e2s mind whirled with the new knowledge.Arrakis\u00e2Dune\u00e2Desert Planet.Thufir Hawat, his father\u00e2s Master of Assassins, had explained it: theirmortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holdingthe planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine thegeriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced bythe House of Atreides in fief-complete-an apparent victory for the Duke Leto.Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for theDuke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad.\u00e2A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,\u00e2 Hawat had said.Arrakis\u00e2Dune\u00e2Desert Planet.Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all aroundhim moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like acathedral as he listened to a faint sound\u00e2the drip-drip-drip of water. Evenwhile he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it uponawakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions.The dream faded.Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed\u00e2thinking ... thinking.This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age,perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hintedthat the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. Theplanet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar tocommand them: will-o\u00e2-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on nocensus of the Imperial Regate."
