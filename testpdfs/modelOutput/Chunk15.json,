    "userPrompt": "quality of her training exposed in his voice. \u201cMost educated people know that\nthe worst potential competition for any young organism can come from its\nown kind.\u201d He deliberately forked a bite of food from his companion\u2019s plate,\nate it. \u201cThey are eating from the same bowl. They have the same basic\nrequirements.\u201d\nThe banker stiffened, scowled at the Duke.\n\u201cDo not make the error of considering my son a child,\u201d the Duke said. And\nhe smiled.\nJessica glanced around the table, noted that Bewt had brightened, that both\nKynes and the smuggler, Tuek, were grinning.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rule of ecology,\u201d Kynes said, \u201cthat the young Master appears to\nunderstand quite well. The struggle between life elements is the struggle for\nthe free energy of a system. Blood\u2019s an efficient energy source.\u201d\nThe banker put down his fork, spoke in an angry voice: \u201cIt\u2019s said that the\nFremen scum drink the blood of their dead.\u201d\nKynes shook his head, spoke in a lecturing tone: \u201cNot the blood, sir. But\nall of a man\u2019s water, ultimately, belongs to his people\u2014to his tribe. It\u2019s a\nnecessity when you live near the Great Flat. All water\u2019s precious there, and\nthe human body is composed of some seventy per cent water by weight. A\ndead man, surely, no longer requires that water.\u201d\nThe banker put both hands against the table beside his plate, and Jessica\nthought he was going to push himself back, leave in a rage.\nKynes looked at Jessica. \u201cForgive me, my Lady, for elaborating on such an\nugly subject at table, but you were being told falsehood and it needed\nclarifying.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve associated so long with Fremen that you\u2019ve lost all sensibilities,\u201d\nthe banker rasped.\nKynes looked at him calmly, studied the pale, trembling face. \u201cAre you\nchallenging me, sir?\u201d\nThe banker froze. He swallowed, spoke stiffly: \u201cOf course not. I\u2019d not so\ninsult our host and hostess.\u201d\nJessica heard the fear in the man\u2019s voice, saw it in his face, in his\nbreathing, in the pulse of a vein at his temple. The man was terrified of\nKynes!\n\u201cOur host and hostess are quite capable of deciding for themselves when\nthey\u2019ve been insulted,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cThey\u2019re brave people who understand\ndefense of honor. We all may attest to their courage by the fact that they are\nhere... now... on Arrakis.\u201d\nJessica saw that Leto was enjoying this. Most of the others were not.\nPeople all around the table sat poised for flight, hands out of sight under the\ntable. Two notable exceptions were Bewt, who was openly smiling at the\nbanker\u2019s discomfiture, and the smuggler, Tuek, who appeared to be watching\nKynes for a cue. Jessica saw that Paul was looking at Kynes in admiration.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cI meant no offense,\u201d the banker muttered. \u201cIf offense was taken, please\naccept my apologies.\u201d\n\u201cFreely given, freely accepted,\u201d Kynes said. He smiled at Jessica, resumed\neating as though nothing had happened.\nJessica saw that the smuggler, too, had relaxed. She marked this: the man\nhad shown every aspect of an aide ready to leap to Kynes\u2019 assistance. There\nexisted an accord of some sort between Kynes and Tuek.\nLeto toyed with a fork, looked speculatively at Kynes. The ecologist\u2019s\nmanner indicated a change in attitude toward the House of Atreides. Kynes\nhad seemed colder on their trip over the desert.\nJessica signaled for another course of food and drink. Servants appeared\nwith langues de lapins de garenne\u2014red wine and a sauce of mushroom-yeast\non the side.\nSlowly, the dinner conversation resumed, but Jessica heard the agitation in\nit, the brittle quality, saw that the banker ate in sullen silence. Kynes would\nhave killed him without hesitating, she thought. And she realized that there\nwas an offhand attitude toward killing in Kynes\u2019 manner. He was a casual\nkiller, and she guessed that this was a Fremen quality.\nJessica turned to the stillsuit manufacturer on her left, said: \u201cI find myself\ncontinually amazed by the importance of water on Arrakis.\u201d\n\u201cVery important,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWhat is this dish? It\u2019s delicious.\u201d\n\u201cTongues of wild rabbit in a special sauce,\u201d she said. \u201cA very old recipe.\u201d\n\u201cI must have that recipe,\u201d the man said.\nShe nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see that you get it.\u201d\nKynes looked at Jessica, said: \u201cThe newcomer to Arrakis frequently\nunderestimates the importance of water here. You are dealing, you see, with\nthe Law of the Minimum.\u201d\nShe heard the testing quality in his voice, said, \u201cGrowth is limited by that\nnecessity which is present in the least amount. And, naturally, the least\nfavorable condition controls the growth rate.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare to find members of a Great House aware of planetological\nproblems,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cWater is the least favorable condition for life on\nArrakis. And remember that growth itself can produce unfavorable conditions\nunless treated with extreme care.\u201d\nJessica sensed a hidden message in Kynes\u2019 words, but knew she was\nmissing it. \u201cGrowth,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you mean Arrakis can have an orderly\ncycle of water to sustain human life under more favorable conditions?\u201d\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d the water magnate barked.\nJessica turned her attention to Bewt. \u201cImpossible?\u201d\n\u201cImpossible on Arrakis,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to this dreamer. All the\nlaboratory evidence is against him.\u201d\nKynes looked at Bewt, and Jessica noted that the other conversations\naround the table had stopped while people concentrated on this new\ninterchange.\n\u201cLaboratory evidence tends to blind us to a very simple fact,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cThat fact is this: we are dealing here with matters that originated and exist\nout-of-doors where plants and animals carry on their normal existence.\u201d\n\u201cNormal!\u201d Bewt snorted. \u201cNothing about Arrakis is normal!\u201d\n\u201cQuite the contrary,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cCertain harmonies could be set up here\nalong self-sustaining lines. You merely have to understand the limits of the\nplanet and the pressures upon it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll never be done,\u201d Bewt said.\nThe Duke came to a sudden realization, placing the point where Kynes\u2019\nattitude had changed\u2014it had been when Jessica had spoken of holding the\nconservatory plants in trust for Arrakis.\n\u201cWhat would it take to set up the self-sustaining system, Doctor Kynes?\u201d\nLeto asked.\n\u201cIf we can get three per cent of the green plant element on Arrakis\ninvolved in forming carbon compounds as foodstuffs, we\u2019ve started the cyclic\nsystem,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cWater\u2019s the only problem?\u201d the Duke asked. He sensed Kynes\u2019\nexcitement, felt himself caught up in it.\n\u201cWater overshadows the other problems,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cThis planet has\nmuch oxygen without its usual concomitants\u2014widespread plant life and large\nsources of free carbon dioxide from such phenomena as volcanoes. There are\nunusual chemical interchanges over large surface areas here.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have pilot projects?\u201d the Duke asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a long time in which to build up the Tansley Effect\u2014small-\nunit experiments on an amateur basis from which my science may now draw\nits working facts,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t enough water,\u201d Bewt said. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t enough water.\u201d\n\u201cMaster Bewt is an expert on water,\u201d Kynes said. He smiled, turned back\nto his dinner.\nThe Duke gestured sharply down with his right hand, barked: \u201cNo! I want\nan answer! Is there enough water, Doctor Kynes?\u201d\nKynes stared at his plate.\nJessica watched the play of emotion on his face. He masks himself well,\nshe thought, but she had him registered now and read that he regretted his\nwords.\n\u201cIs there enough water!\u201d the Duke demanded.\n\u201cThere... may be,\u201d Kynes said.\nHe\u2019s faking uncertainty! Jessica thought.\nWith his deeper truthsense, Paul caught the underlying motive, had to use\nevery ounce of his training to mask his excitement. There is enough water!\nBut Kynes doesn\u2019t wish it to be known.\n\u201cOur planetologist has many interesting dreams,\u201d Bewt said. \u201cHe dreams\nwith the Fremen\u2014of prophecies and messiahs.\u201d\nChuckles sounded at odd places around the table. Jessica marked them\u2014\nthe smuggler, the stillsuit manufacturer\u2019s daughter, Duncan Idaho, the\nwoman with the mysterious escort service.\nTensions are oddly distributed here tonight, Jessica thought. There\u2019s too\nmuch going on of which I\u2019m not aware. I\u2019ll have to develop new information\nsources.\nThe Duke passed his gaze from Kynes to Bewt to Jessica. He felt oddly let\ndown, as though something vital had passed him here. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he muttered.\nKynes spoke quickly: \u201cPerhaps we should discuss this another time, my\nLord. There are so many\u2014\u201d\nThe planetologist broke off as a uniformed Atreides trooper hurried in\nthrough the service door, was passed by the guard and rushed to the Duke\u2019s\nside. The man bent, whispering into Leto\u2019s ear.\nJessica recognized the capsign of Hawat\u2019s corps, fought down uneasiness.\nShe addressed herself to the stillsuit manufacturer\u2019s feminine companion\u2014a\ntiny, dark-haired woman with a doll face, a touch of epicanthic fold to the\neyes.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve hardly touched your dinner, my dear,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cMay I order\nyou something?\u201d\nThe woman looked at the stillsuit manufacturer before answering, then:\n\u201cI\u2019m not very hungry.\u201d\nAbruptly, the Duke stood up beside his trooper, spoke in a harsh tone of\ncommand: \u201cStay seated, everyone. You will have to forgive me, but a matter\nhas arisen that requires my personal attention.\u201d He stepped aside. \u201cPaul, take\nover as host for me, if you please.\u201d\nPaul stood, wanting to ask why his father had to leave, knowing he had to\nplay this with the grand manner. He moved around to his father\u2019s chair, sat\ndown in it.\nThe Duke turned to the alcove where Halleck sat, said: \u201cGurney, please\ntake Paul\u2019s place at table. We mustn\u2019t have an odd number here. When the\ndinner\u2019s over, I may want you to bring Paul to the field C.P. Wait for my\ncall.\u201d\nHalleck emerged from the alcove in dress uniform, his lumpy ugliness\nseeming out of place in the glittering finery. He leaned his baliset against the\nwall, crossed to the chair Paul had occupied, sat down.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for alarm,\u201d the Duke said, \u201cbut I must ask that no one\nleave until our house guard says it\u2019s safe. You will be perfectly secure as long\nas you remain here, and we\u2019ll have this little trouble cleared up very shortly.\u201d\nPaul caught the code words in his father\u2019s message\u2014guard\u2014safe\u2014secure-\nshortly. The problem was security, not violence. He saw that his mother had\nread the same message. They both relaxed.\nThe Duke gave a short nod, wheeled and strode through the service door\nfollowed by his trooper.\nPaul said: \u201cPlease go on with your dinner. I believe Doctor Kynes was\ndiscussing water.\u201d\n\u201cMay we discuss it another time?\u201d Kynes asked.\u201d\n\u201cBy all means,\u201d Paul said.\nAnd Jessica noted with pride her son\u2019s dignity, the mature sense of\nassurance.\nThe banker picked up his water flagon, gestured with it at Bewt. \u201cNone of\nus here can surpass Master Lingar Bewt in flowery phrases. One might\nalmost assume he aspired to Great House status. Come, Master Bewt, lead us\nin a toast. Perhaps you\u2019ve a dollop of wisdom for the boy who must be\ntreated like a man.\u201d\nJessica clenched her right hand into a fist beneath the table. She saw a\nhandsignal pass from Halleck to Idaho, saw the house troopers along the\nwalls move into positions of maximum guard.\nBewt cast a venomous glare at the banker.\nPaul glanced at Halleck, took in the defensive positions of his guards,\nlooked at the banker until the man lowered the water flagon. He said: \u201cOnce,\non Caladan, I saw the body of a drowned fisherman recovered. He\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDrowned?\u201d It was the stillsuit manufacturer\u2019s daughter.\nPaul hesitated, then: \u201cYes. Immersed in water until dead. Drowned. \u201d\n\u201cWhat an interesting way to die,\u201d she murmured.\nPaul\u2019s smile became brittle. He returned his attention to the banker. \u201cThe\ninteresting thing about this man was the wounds on his shoulders\u2014made by\nanother fisherman\u2019s claw-boots. This fisherman was one of several in a boat\n\u2014a craft for traveling on water\u2014that foundered ... sank beneath the water.\nAnother fisherman helping recover the body said he\u2019d seen marks like this\nman\u2019s wounds several times. They meant another drowning fisherman had\ntried to stand on this poor fellow\u2019s shoulders in the attempt to reach up to the\nsurface\u2014to reach air.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is this interesting?\u201d the banker asked.\n\u201cBecause of an observation made by my father at the time. He said the\ndrowning man who climbs on your shoulders to save himself is\nunderstandable\u2014except when you see it happen in the drawing room.\u201d Paul\nhesitated just long enough for the banker to see the point coming, then: \u201cAnd,\nI should add, except when you see it at the dinner table.\u201d\nA sudden stillness enfolded the room.\nThat was rash, Jessica thought. This banker might have enough rank to\ncall my son out. She saw that Idaho was poised for instant action. The House\ntroopers were alert. Gurney Halleck had his eyes on the men opposite him.\n\u201cHo-ho-ho-o-o-o!\u201d It was the smuggler, Tuek, head thrown back laughing\nwith complete abandon.\nNervous smiles appeared around the table.\nBewt was grinning.\nThe banker had pushed his chair back, was glaring at Paul.\nKynes said: \u201cOne baits an Atreides at his own risk.\u201d\n\u201cIs it Atreides custom to insult their guests?\u201d the banker demanded.\nBefore Paul could answer, Jessica leaned forward, said: \u201cSir!\u201d And she\nthought: We must learn this Harkonnen creature\u2019s game. Is he here to try for\nPaul? Does he have help?\n\u201cMy son displays a general garment and you claim it\u2019s cut to your fit?\u201d\nJessica asked. \u201cWhat a fascinating revelation.\u201d She slid a hand down to her\nleg to the crysknife she had fastened in a calf-sheath.\nThe banker turned his glare on Jessica. Eyes shifted away from Paul and\nshe saw him ease himself back from the table, freeing himself for action. He\nhad focused on the code word: garment. \u201cPrepare for violence. \u201d\nKynes directed a speculative look at Jessica, gave a subtle hand signal to\nTuek.\nThe smuggler lurched to his feet, lifted his flagon. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a toast,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cTo young Paul Atreides, still a lad by his looks, but a man by his\nactions.\u201d\nWhy do they intrude? Jessica asked herself.\nThe banker stared now at Kynes, and Jessica saw terror return to the\nagent\u2019s face.\nPeople began responding all around the table.\nWhere Kynes leads, people follow, Jessica thought. He has told us he sides\nwith Paul. What\u2019s the secret of his power? It can\u2019t be because he\u2019s Judge of\nthe Change. That\u2019s temporary. And certainly not because he\u2019s a civil servant.\nShe removed her hand from the crysknife hilt, lifted her flagon to Kynes,\nwho responded in kind.\nOnly Paul and the banker\u2014(Soo-Soo! What an idiotic nickname! Jessica\nthought.)\u2014remained empty-handed. The banker\u2019s attention stayed fixed on\nKynes. Paul stared at his plate.\nI was handling it correctly, Paul thought. Why do they interfere? He\nglanced covertly at the male guests nearest him. Prepare for violence? From\nwhom? Certainly not from that banker fellow.\nHalleck stirred, spoke as though to no one in particular, directing his words\nover the heads of the guests across from him: \u201cIn our society, people\nshouldn\u2019t be quick to take offense. It\u2019s frequently suicidal.\u201d He looked at the\nstillsuit manufacturer\u2019s daughter beside him. \u201cDon\u2019t you think so, miss?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes. Yes. Indeed I do,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s too much violence. It\nmakes me sick. And lots of times no offense is meant, but people die anyway.\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Halleck said.\nJessica saw the near perfection of the girl\u2019s act, realized: That empty-\nheaded little female is not an empty-headed little female. She saw then the\npattern of the threat and understood that Halleck, too, had detected it. They\nhad planned to lure Paul with sex. Jessica relaxed. Her son had probably been\nthe first to see it\u2014his training hadn\u2019t overlooked that obvious gambit.\nKynes spoke to the banker: \u201cIsn\u2019t another apology in order?\u201d\nThe banker turned a sickly grin toward Jessica, said: \u201cMy Lady, I fear I\u2019ve\noverindulged in your wines. You serve potent drink at table, and I\u2019m not\naccustomed to it.\u201d\nJessica heard the venom beneath his tone, spoke sweetly: \u201cWhen strangers\nmeet, great allowance should be made for differences of custom and\ntraining.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, my Lady,\u201d he said.\nThe dark-haired companion of the stillsuit manufacturer leaned toward\nJessica, said: \u201cThe Duke spoke of our being secure here. I do hope that\ndoesn\u2019t mean more fighting.\u201d\nShe was directed to lead the conversation this way, Jessica thought.\n\u201cLikely this will prove unimportant,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much\ndetail requiring the Duke\u2019s personal attention in these times. As long as\nenmity continues between Atreides and Harkonnen we cannot be too careful.\nThe Duke has sworn kanly. He will leave no Harkonnen agent alive on\nArrakis, of course.\u201d She glanced at the Guild Bank agent. \u201cAnd the\nConventions, naturally, support him in this.\u201d She shifted her attention to\nKynes. \u201cIs this not so, Dr. Kynes?\u201d\n\u201cIndeed it is,\u201d Kynes said.\nThe stillsuit manufacturer pulled his companion gently back. She looked at\nhim, said: \u201cI do believe I\u2019ll eat something now. I\u2019d like some of that bird dish\nyou served earlier.\u201d\nJessica signalled a servant, turned to the banker: \u201cAnd you, sir, were\nspeaking of birds earlier and of their habits. I find so many interesting things\nabout Arrakis. Tell me, where is the spice found? Do the hunters go deep into\nthe desert?\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, my Lady,\u201d he said. \u201cVery little\u2019s known of the deep desert. And\nalmost nothing of the southern regions.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tale that a great Mother Lode of spice is to be found in the\nsouthern reaches,\u201d Kynes said, \u201cbut I suspect it was an imaginative invention\nmade solely for purposes of a song. Some daring spice hunters do, on\noccasion, penetrate into the edge of the central belt, but that\u2019s extremely\ndangerous\u2014navigation is uncertain, storms are frequent. Casualties increase\ndramatically the farther you operate from Shield Wall bases. It hasn\u2019t been\nfound profitable to venture too far south. Perhaps if we had a weather\nsatellite....\u201d\nBewt looked up, spoke around a mouthful of food: \u201cIt\u2019s said the Fremen\ntravel there, that they go anywhere and have hunted out soaks and sip-wells\neven in the southern latitudes.\u201d\n\u201cSoaks and sip-wells?\u201d Jessica asked.\nKynes spoke quickly: \u201cWild rumors, my Lady. These are known on other\nplanets, not on Arrakis. A soak is a place where water seeps to the surface or\nnear enough to the surface to be found by digging according to certain signs.\nA sip-well is a form of soak where a person draws water through a straw... so\nit is said.\u201d\nThere\u2019s deception in his words, Jessica thought.\nWhy is he lying? Paul wondered.\n\u201cHow very interesting,\u201d Jessica said. And she thought. \u201cIt is said....\u201d What\na curious speech mannerism they have here. If they only knew what it reveals\nabout their dependence on superstitions.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard you have a saying,\u201d Paul said, \u201cthat polish comes from the\ncities, wisdom from the desert.\u201d\n\u201cThere are many sayings on Arrakis,\u201d Kynes said.\nBefore Jessica could frame a new question, a servant bent over her with a\nnote. She opened it, saw the Duke\u2019s handwriting and code signs, scanned it.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll all be delighted to know,\u201d she said, \u201cthat our Duke sends his\nreassurances. The matter which called him away has been settled. The\nmissing carryall has been found. A Harkonnen agent in the crew\noverpowered the others and flew the machine to a smugglers\u2019 base, hoping to\nsell it there. Both man and machine were turned over to our forces.\u201d She\nnodded to Tuek.\nThe smuggler nodded back.\nJessica refolded the note, tucked it into her sleeve.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t come to open battle,\u201d the banker said. \u201cThe people have\nsuch hopes the Atreides will bring peace and prosperity.\u201d\n\u201cEspecially prosperity,\u201d Bewt said.\n\u201cShall we have our dessert now?\u201d Jessica asked. \u201cI\u2019ve had our chef prepare\na Caladan sweet: pongi rice in sauce dolsa.\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds wonderful,\u201d the stillsuit manufacturer said. \u201cWould it be\npossible to get the recipe?\u201d\n\u201cAny recipe you desire,\u201d Jessica said, registering the man for later mention\nto Hawat. The stillsuit manufacturer was a fearful little climber and could be\nbought.\nSmall talk resumed around her: \u201cSuch a lovely fabric....\u201d \u201cHe is having a\nsetting made to match the jewel....\u201d \u201cWe might try for a production increase\nnext quarter....\u201d\nJessica stared down at her plate, thinking of the coded part of Leto\u2019s\nmessage: The Harkonnens tried to get in a shipment of lasguns. We captured\nthem. This may mean they\u2019ve succeeded with other shipments. It certainly\nmeans they don\u2019t place much store in shields. Take appropriate precautions.\nJessica focused her mind on lasguns, wondering. The white-hot beams of\ndisruptive light could cut through any known substance, provided that\nsubstance was not shielded. The fact that feedback from a shield would\nexplode both lasgun and shield did not bother the Harkonnens. Why? A\nlasgun-shield explosion was a dangerous variable, could be more powerful\nthan atomics, could kill only the gunner and his shielded target.\nThe unknowns here filled her with uneasiness.\nPaul said: \u201cI never doubted we\u2019d find the carryall. Once my father moves\nto solve a problem, he solves it. This is a fact the Harkonnens are beginning\nto discover.\u201d\nHe\u2019s boasting, Jessica thought. He shouldn\u2019t boast. No person who\u2019ll be\nsleeping far below ground level this night as a precaution against lasguns\nhas the right to boast.\n"
