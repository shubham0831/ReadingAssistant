    "userPrompt": "repose, muttering in open agitation. One cried out: \u201cLisan al-Gaib!\u201d\nKynes whirled, gave a curt, chopping signal with a hand, waved the guard\naway. They fell back, grumbling among themselves, trailed away around the\nbuilding.\n\u201cMost interesting,\u201d Leto said.\nKynes passed a hard glare over the Duke and Paul, said: \u201cMost of the\ndesert natives here are a superstitious lot. Pay no attention to them. They\nmean no harm.\u201d But he thought of the words of the legend: \u201cThey will greet\nyou with Holy Words and your gifts will be a blessing. \u201d\nLeto\u2019s assessment of Kynes\u2014based partly on Hawat\u2019s brief verbal report\n(guarded and full of suspicions)\u2014suddenly crystallized: the man was\nFremen. Kynes had come with a Fremen escort, which could mean simply\nthat the Fremen were testing their new freedom to enter urban areas\u2014but it\nhad seemed an honor guard. And by his manner, Kynes was a proud man,\naccustomed to freedom, his tongue and his manner guarded only by his own\nsuspicions. Paul\u2019s question had been direct and pertinent.\nKynes had gone native.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be going, Sire?\u201d Halleck asked.\nThe Duke nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll fly my own \u2018thopter. Kynes can sit up front with\nme to direct me. You and Paul take the rear seats.\u201d\n\u201cOne moment, please,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cWith your permission, Sire, I must\ncheck the security of your suits.\u201d\nThe Duke started to speak, but Kynes pressed on: \u201cI have concern for my\nown flesh as well as yours ... my Lord. I\u2019m well aware of whose throat would\nbe slit should harm befall you two while you\u2019re in my care.\u201d\nThe Duke frowned, thinking: How delicate this moment! If I refuse, it may\noffend him. And this could be a man whose value to me is beyond measure.\nYet ... to let him inside my shield, touching my person when I know so little\nabout him?\nThe thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in your hands,\u201d the Duke said. He stepped forward, opening his robe,\nsaw Halleck come up on the balls of his feet, poised and alert, but remaining\nwhere he was. \u201cAnd, if you\u2019d be so kind,\u201d the Duke said, \u201cI\u2019d appreciate an\nexplanation of the suit from one who lives so intimately with it.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d Kynes said. He felt up under the robe for the shoulder seals,\nspeaking as he examined the suit. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a micro-sandwich\u2014a high-\nefficiency filter and heat-exchange system.\u201d He adjusted the shoulder seals.\n\u201cThe skin-contact layer\u2019s porous. Perspiration passes through it, having\ncooled the body... near-normal evaporation process. The next two layers...\u201d\nKynes tightened the chest fit. \u201c... include heat exchange filaments and salt\nprecipitators. Salt\u2019s reclaimed.\u201d\nThe Duke lifted his arms at a gesture, said: \u201cMost interesting.\u201d\n\u201cBreathe deeply,\u201d Kynes said.\nThe Duke obeyed.\nKynes studied the underarm seals, adjusted one. \u201cMotions of the body,\nespecially breathing,\u201d he said, \u201cand some osmotic action provide the\npumping force.\u201d He loosened the chest fit slightly. \u201cReclaimed water\ncirculates to catchpockets from which you draw it through this tube in the\nclip at your neck.\u201d\nThe Duke twisted his chin in and down to look at the end of the tube.\n\u201cEfficient and convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cGood engineering.\u201d\nKynes knelt, examined the leg seals. \u201cUrine and feces are processed in the\nthigh pads,\u201d he said, and stood up, felt the neck fitting, lifted a sectioned flap\nthere. \u201cIn the open desert, you wear this filter across your face, this tube in\nthe nostrils with these plugs to insure a tight fit. Breathe in through the mouth\nfilter, out through the nose tube. With a Fremen suit in good working order,\nyou won\u2019t lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a day\u2014even if you\u2019re\ncaught in the Great Erg.\u201d\n\u201cA thimbleful a day,\u201d the Duke said.\nKynes pressed a finger against the suit\u2019s forehead pad, said: \u201cThis may rub\na little. If it irritates you, please tell me. I could slit-patch it a bit tighter.\u201d\n\u201cMy thanks,\u201d the Duke said. He moved his shoulders in the suit as Kynes\nstepped back, realizing that it did feel better now\u2014tighter and less irritating.\nKynes turned to Paul. \u201cNow, let\u2019s have a look at you, lad.\u201d\nA good man but he\u2019ll have to learn to address us properly, the Duke\nthought.\nPaul stood passively as Kynes inspected the suit. It had been an odd\nsensation putting on the crinkling, slick-surfaced garment. In his\nforeconsciousness had been the absolute knowledge that he had never before\nworn a stillsuit. Yet, each motion of adjusting the adhesion tabs under\nGurney\u2019s inexpert guidance had seemed natural, instinctive. When he had\ntightened the chest to gain maximum pumping action from the motion of\nbreathing, he had known what he did and why. When he had fitted the neck\nand forehead tabs tightly, he had known it was to prevent friction blisters.\nKynes straightened, stepped back with a puzzled expression. \u201cYou\u2019ve\nworn a stillsuit before?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cThis is the first time.\u201d\n\u201cThen someone adjusted it for you?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYour desert boots are fitted slip-fashion at the ankles. Who told you to do\nthat?\u201d\n\u201cIt... seemed the right way.\u201d\n\u201cThat it most certainly is.\u201d\nAnd Kynes rubbed his cheek, thinking of the legend: \u201cHe shall know your\nways as though born to them. \u201d\n\u201cWe waste time,\u201d the Duke said. He gestured to the waiting \u2018thopter, led\nthe way, accepting the guard\u2019s salute with a nod. He climbed in, fastened his\nsafety harness, checked controls and instruments. The craft creaked as the\nothers clambered aboard.\nKynes fastened his harness, focused on the padded comfort of the aircraft\n\u2014soft luxury of gray-green upholstery, gleaming instruments, the sensation\nof filtered and washed air in his lungs as doors slammed and vent fans\nwhirred alive.\nSo soft! he thought.\n\u201cAll secure, Sire,\u201d Halleck said.\nLeto fed power to the wings, felt them cup and dip\u2014once, twice. They\nwere airborne in ten meters, wings feathered tightly and afterjets thrusting\nthem upward in a steep, hissing climb.\n\u201cSoutheast over the Shield Wall,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I told your\nsandmaster to concentrate his equipment.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\nThe Duke banked into his air cover, the other craft taking up their guard\npositions as they headed southeast.\n\u201cThe design and manufacture of these stillsuits bespeaks a high degree of\nsophistication,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cSomeday I may show you a sietch factory,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cI would find that interesting,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cI note that suits are\nmanufactured also in some of the garrison cities.\u201d\n\u201cInferior copies,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cAny Dune man who values his skin wears a\nFremen suit.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it\u2019ll hold your water loss to a thimbleful a day?\u201d\n\u201cProperly suited, your forehead cap tight, all seals in order, your major\nwater loss is through the palms of your hands,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cYou can wear\nsuit gloves if you\u2019re not using your hands for critical work, but most Fremen\nin the open desert rub their hands with juice from the leaves of the creosote\nbush. It inhibits perspiration.\u201d\nThe Duke glanced down to the left at the broken landscape of the Shield\nWall\u2014chasms of tortured rock, patches of yellow-brown crossed by black\nlines of fault shattering. It was as though someone had dropped this ground\nfrom space and left it where it smashed.\nThey crossed a shallow basin with the clear outline of gray sand spreading\nacross it from a canyon opening to the south. The sand fingers ran out into\nthe basin\u2014a dry delta outlined against darker rock.\nKynes sat back, thinking about the water-fat flesh he had felt beneath the\nstillsuits. They wore shield belts over their robes, slow pellet stunners at the\nwaist, coin-sized emergency transmitters on cords around their necks. Both\nthe Duke and his son carried knives in wrist sheathes and the sheathes\nappeared well worn. The people struck Kynes as a strange combination of\nsoftness and armed strength. There was a poise to them totally unlike the\nHarkonnens.\n\u201cWhen you report to the Emperor on the change of government here, will\nyou say we observed the rules?\u201d Leto asked. He glanced at Kynes, back to\ntheir course.\n\u201cThe Harkonnens left; you came,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cAnd is everything as it should be?\u201d Leto asked.\nMomentary tension showed in the tightening of a muscle along Kynes\u2019\njaw. \u201cAs Planetologist and Judge of the Change, I am a direct subject of the\nImperium... my Lord.\u201d\nThe Duke smiled grimly. \u201cBut we both know the realities.\u201d\n\u201cI remind you that His Majesty supports my work.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed? And what is your work?\u201d\nIn the brief silence, Paul thought: He\u2019s pushing this Kynes too hard. Paul\nglanced at Halleck, but the minstrel-warrior was staring out at the barren\nlandscape.\nKynes spoke stiffly: \u201cYou, of course, refer to my duties as planetologist.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cIt is mostly dry land biology and botany... some geological work\u2014core\ndrilling and testing. You never really exhaust the possibilities of an entire\nplanet.\u201d\n\u201cDo you also investigate the spice?\u201d\nKynes turned, and Paul noted the hard line of the man\u2019s cheek. \u201cA curious\nquestion, my Lord.\u201d\n\u201cBear in mind, Kynes, that this is now my fief. My methods differ from\nthose of the Harkonnens. I don\u2019t care if you study the spice as long as I share\nwhat you discover.\u201d He glanced at the planetologist. \u201cThe Harkonnens\ndiscouraged investigation of the spice, didn\u2019t they?\u201d\nKynes stared back without answering.\n\u201cYou may speak plainly,\u201d the Duke said, \u201cwithout fear for your skin.\u201d\n\u201cThe Imperial Court is, indeed, a long way off,\u201d Kynes muttered. And he\nthought: What does this water-soft invader expect? Does he think me fool\nenough to enlist with him?\nThe Duke chuckled, keeping his attention on their course. \u201cI detect a sour\nnote in your voice, sir. We\u2019ve waded in here with our mob of tame killers,\neh? And we expect you to realize immediately that we\u2019re different from the\nHarkonnens?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the propaganda you\u2019ve flooded into sietch and village,\u201d Kynes\nsaid. \u201c\u2018Love the good Duke!\u2019 Your corps of\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHere now!\u201d Halleck barked. He snapped his attention away from the\nwindow, leaned forward.\nPaul put a hand on Halleck\u2019s arm.\n\u201cGurney!\u201d the Duke said. He glanced back. \u201cThis man\u2019s been long under\nthe Harkonnens.\u201d\nHalleck sat back. \u201cAyah.\u201d\n\u201cYour man Hawat\u2019s subtle,\u201d Kynes said, \u201cbut his object\u2019s plain enough.\u201d\n\u201cWill you open those bases to us, then?\u201d the Duke asked.\nKynes spoke curtly: \u201cThey\u2019re His Majesty\u2019s property.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not being used.\u201d\n\u201cThey could be used.\u201d\n\u201cDoes His Majesty concur?\u201d\nKynes darted a hard stare at the Duke. \u201cArrakis could be an Eden if its\nrulers would look up from grubbing for spice!\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t answer my question, the Duke thought. And he said: \u201cHow is a\nplanet to become an Eden without money?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is money,\u201d Kynes asked, \u201cif it won\u2019t buy the services you need?\u201d\nAh, now! the Duke thought. And he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this another time.\nRight now, I believe we\u2019re coming to the edge of the Shield Wall. Do I hold\nthe same course?\u201d\n\u201cThe same course,\u201d Kynes muttered.\nPaul looked out his window. Beneath them, the broken ground began to\ndrop away in tumbled creases toward a barren rock plain and a knife-edged\nshelf. Beyond the shelf, fingernail crescents of dunes marched toward the\nhorizon with here and there in the distance a dull smudge, a darker blotch to\ntell of something not sand. Rock outcroppings, perhaps. In the heat-addled\nair, Paul couldn\u2019t be sure.\n\u201cAre there any plants down there?\u201d Paul asked.\n\u201cSome,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cThis latitude\u2019s life-zone has mostly what we call\nminor water stealers\u2014adapted to raiding each other for moisture, gobbling up\nthe trace-dew. Some parts of the desert teem with life. But all of it has\nlearned how to survive under these rigors. If you get caught down there, you\nimitate that life or you die.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean steal water from each other?\u201d Paul asked. The idea outraged\nhim, and his voice betrayed his emotion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d Kynes said, \u201cbut that wasn\u2019t precisely my meaning. You see,\nmy climate demands a special attitude toward water. You are aware of water\nat all times. You waste nothing that contains moisture.\u201d\nAnd the Duke thought: \u201c... my climate!\u201d\n\u201cCome around two degrees more southerly, my Lord,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a blow coming up from the west.\u201d\nThe Duke nodded. He had seen the billowing of tan dust there. He banked\nthe \u2018thopter around, noting the way the escort\u2019s wings reflected milky orange\nfrom the dust-refracted light as they turned to keep pace with him.\n\u201cThis should clear the storm\u2019s edge,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cThat sand must be dangerous if you fly into it,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWill it really\ncut the strongest metals?\u201d\n\u201cAt this altitude, it\u2019s not sand but dust,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cThe danger is lack of\nvisibility, turbulence, clogged intakes.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see actual spice mining today?\u201d Paul asked.\n\u201cVery likely,\u201d Kynes said.\nPaul sat back. He had used the questions and hyperawareness to do what\nhis mother called \u201cregistering\u201d the person. He had Kynes now\u2014tone of\nvoice, each detail of face and gesture. An unnatural folding of the left sleeve\non the man\u2019s robe told of a knife in an arm sheath. The waist bulged\nstrangely. It was said that desert men wore a belted sash into which they\ntucked small necessities. Perhaps the bulges came from such a sash\u2014\ncertainly not from a concealed shield belt. A copper pin engraved with the\nlikeness of a hare clasped the neck of Kynes\u2019 robe. Another smaller pin with\nsimilar likeness hung at the corner of the hood which was thrown back over\nhis shoulders.\nHalleck twisted in the seat beside Paul, reached back into the rear\ncompartment and brought out his baliset. Kynes looked around as Halleck\ntuned the instrument, then returned his attention to their course.\n\u201cWhat would you like to hear, young Master?\u201d Halleck asked.\n\u201cYou choose, Gurney,\u201d Paul said.\nHalleck bent his ear close to the sounding board, strummed a chord and\nsang softly:\n\u201cOur fathers ate manna in the desert, \nIn the burning places where whirlwinds came. \nLord, save us from that horrible land! \nSave us... oh-h-h-h, save us \nFrom the dry and thirsty land.\u201d\nKynes glanced at the Duke, said: \u201cYou do travel with a light complement\nof guards, my Lord. Are all of them such men of many talents?\u201d\n\u201cGurney?\u201d The Duke chuckled. \u201cGurney\u2019s one of a kind. I like him with\nme for his eyes. His eyes miss very little.\u201d\nThe planetologist frowned.\nWithout missing a beat in his tune, Halleck interposed:\n\u201cFor I am like an owl of the desert, o! \nAiyah! am like an owl of the des-ert!\u201d\nThe Duke reached down, brought up a microphone from the instrument\npanel, thumbed it to life, said: \u201cLeader to Escort Gemma. Flying object at\nnine o\u2019clock, Sector B. Do you identify it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s merely a bird,\u201d Kynes said, and added: \u201cYou have sharp eyes.\u201d\nThe panel speaker crackled, then: \u201cEscort Gemma. Object examined under\nfull amplification. It\u2019s a large bird.\u201d\nPaul looked in the indicated direction, saw the distant speck: a dot of\nintermittent motion, and realized how keyed up his father must be. Every\nsense was at full alert.\n\u201cI\u2019d not realized there were birds that large this far into the desert,\u201d the\nDuke said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s likely an eagle,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cMany creatures have adapted to this\nplace.\u201d\nThe ornithopter swept over a bare rock plain. Paul looked down from their\ntwo thousand meters\u2019 altitude, saw the wrinkled shadow of their craft and\nescort. The land beneath seemed flat, but shadow wrinkles said otherwise.\n\u201cHas anyone ever walked out of the desert?\u201d the Duke asked.\nHalleck\u2019s music stopped. He leaned forward to catch the answer.\n\u201cNot from the deep desert,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cMen have walked out of the\nsecond zone several times. They\u2019ve survived by crossing the rock areas\nwhere worms seldom go.\u201d\nThe timbre of Kynes\u2019 voice held Paul\u2019s attention. He felt his sense come\nalert the way they were trained to do.\n\u201cAh-h, the worms,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cI must see one sometime.\u201d\n\u201cYou may see one today,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cWherever there is spice, there are\nworms.\u201d\n\u201cAlways?\u201d Halleck asked.\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\n\u201cIs there a relationship between worm and spice?\u201d the Duke asked.\nKynes turned and Paul saw the pursed lips as the man spoke. \u201cThey defend\nspice sands. Each worm has a\u2014territory. As to the spice... who knows?\nWorm specimens we\u2019ve examined lead us to suspect complicated chemical\ninterchanges within them. We find traces of hydrochloric acid in the ducts,\nmore complicated acid forms elsewhere. I\u2019ll give you my monograph on the\nsubject.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a shield\u2019s no defense?\u201d the Duke asked.\n\u201cShields!\u201d Kynes sneered. \u201cActivate a shield within the worm zone and\nyou seal your fate. Worms ignore territory lines, come from far around to\nattack a shield. No man wearing a shield has ever survived such attack.\u201d\n\u201cHow are worms taken, then?\u201d\n\u201cHigh voltage electrical shock applied separately to each ring segment is\nthe only known way of killing and preserving an entire worm,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cThey can be stunned and shattered by explosives, but each ring segment has\na life of its own. Barring atomics, I know of no explosive powerful enough to\ndestroy a large worm entirely. They\u2019re incredibly tough.\u201d\n\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t an effort been made to wipe them out?\u201d Paul asked.\n\u201cToo expensive,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cToo much area to cover.\u201d\nPaul leaned back in his corner. His truthsense, awareness of tone shadings,\ntold him that Kynes was lying and telling half-truths. And he thought: If\nthere\u2019s a relationship between spice and worms, killing the worms would\ndestroy the spice.\n\u201cNo one will have to walk out of the desert soon,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cTrip\nthese little transmitters at our necks and rescue is on its way. All our workers\nwill be wearing them before long. We\u2019re setting up a special rescue service.\u201d\n\u201cVery commendable,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cYour tone says you don\u2019t agree,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cAgree? Of course I agree, but it won\u2019t be much use. Static electricity from\nsandstorms masks out many signals. Transmitters short out. They\u2019ve been\ntried here before, you know. Arrakis is tough on equipment. And if a worm\u2019s\nhunting you there\u2019s not much time. Frequently, you have no more than fifteen\nor twenty minutes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you advise?\u201d the Duke asked.\n\u201cYou ask my advice?\u201d\n\u201cAs planetologist, yes.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d follow my advice?\u201d\n\u201cIf I found it sensible.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, my Lord. Never travel alone.\u201d\nThe Duke turned his attention from the controls. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all. Never travel alone.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if you\u2019re separated by a storm and forced down?\u201d Halleck asked.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything you could do?\u201d\n\u201cAnything covers much territory,\u201d Kynes said.\n\u201cWhat would you do?\u201d Paul asked.\nKynes turned a hard stare at the boy, brought his attention back to the\nDuke. \u201cI\u2019d remember to protect the integrity of my stillsuit. If I were outside\nthe worm zone or in rock, I\u2019d stay with the ship. If I were down in open sand,\nI\u2019d get away from the ship as fast as I could. About a thousand meters would\nbe far enough. Then I\u2019d hide beneath my robe. A worm would get the ship,\nbut it might miss me.\u201d\n\u201cThen what?\u201d Halleck asked.\nKynes shrugged. \u201cWait for the worm to leave.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Paul asked.\n\u201cWhen the worm has gone, one may try to walk out,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cYou\nmust walk softly, avoid drum sands, tidal dust basins\u2014head for the nearest\nrock zone. There are many such zones. You might make it.\u201d\n\u201cDrum sand?\u201d Halleck asked.\n\u201cA condition of sand compaction,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cThe slightest step sets it\ndrumming. Worms always come to that.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a tidal dust basin?\u201d the Duke asked.\n\u201cCertain depressions in the desert have filled with dust over the centuries.\nSome are so vast they have currents and tides. All will swallow the unwary\nwho step into them.\u201d\nHalleck sat back, resumed strumming the baliset. Presently, he sang:\n\u201cWild beasts of the desert do hunt there, \nWaiting for the innocents to pass. \nOh-h-h, tempt not the gods of the desert, \nLest you seek a lonely epitaph. \nThe perils of the\u2014\u201d\nHe broke off, leaned forward. \u201cDust cloud ahead, Sire.\u201d\n\u201cI see it, Gurney.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we seek,\u201d Kynes said.\nPaul stretched up in the seat to peer ahead, saw a rolling yellow cloud low\non the desert surface some thirty kilometers ahead.\n\u201cOne of your factory crawlers,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cIt\u2019s on the surface and that\nmeans it\u2019s on spice. The cloud is vented sand being expelled after the spice\nhas been centrifugally removed. There\u2019s no other cloud quite like it.\u201d\n\u201cAircraft over it,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cI see two... three... four spotters,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cThey\u2019re watching for\nwormsign.\u201d\n\u201cWormsign?\u201d the Duke asked.\n\u201cA sandwave moving toward the crawler. They\u2019ll have seismic probes on\nthe surface, too. Worms sometimes travel too deep for the wave to show.\u201d\nKynes swung his gaze around the sky. \u201cShould be a carryall wing around, but\nI don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\u201cThe worm always comes, eh?\u201d Halleck asked.\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\nPaul leaned forward, touched Kynes\u2019 shoulder. \u201cHow big an area does\neach worm stake out?\u201d\nKynes frowned. The child kept asking adult questions.\n\u201cThat depends on the size of the worm.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the variation?\u201d the Duke asked.\n\u201cBig ones may control three or four hundred square kilometers. Small ones\n"
