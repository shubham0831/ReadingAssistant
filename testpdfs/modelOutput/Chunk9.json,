    "userPrompt": "The crossfire of thrown words filled the big room.\n\u201cDid you get a good look at this hole on the way down? Where\u2019s all the\nloot this place\u2019s supposed to have?\u201d \u201cThe Harkonnens took it with \u2019em!\u201d \u201cMe\nfor a hot shower and a soft bed!\u201d \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard, stupid? No showers\ndown here. You scrub your ass with sand!\u201d \u201cHey! Can it! The Duke!\u201d\nThe Duke stepped out of the stair entry into a suddenly silent room.\nGurney Halleck strode along at the point of the crowd, bag over one shoulder,\nthe neck of his nine-string baliset clutched in the other hand. They were long-\nfingered hands with big thumbs, full of tiny movements that drew such\ndelicate music from the baliset.\nThe Duke watched Halleck, admiring the ugly lump of a man, noting the\nglass-splinter eyes with their gleam of savage understanding. Here was a man\nwho lived outside the faufreluches while obeying their every precept. What\nwas it Paul had called him? \u201cGurney, the valorous. \u201d\nHalleck\u2019s wispy blond hair trailed across barren spots on his head. His\nwide mouth was twisted into a pleasant sneer, and the scar of the inkvine\nwhip slashed across his jawline seemed to move with a life of its own. His\nwhole air was of casual, shoulder-set capability. He came up to the Duke,\nbowed.\n\u201cGurney,\u201d Leto said.\n\u201cMy Lord.\u201d He gestured with the baliset toward the men in the room. \u201cThis\nis the last of them. I\u2019d have preferred coming in with the first wave, but....\u201d\n\u201cThere are still some Harkonnens for you,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cStep aside with\nme, Gurney, where we may talk.\u201d\n\u201cYours to command, my Lord.\u201d\nThey moved into an alcove beside a coil-slot water machine while the men\nstirred restlessly in the big room. Halleck dropped his bag into a corner, kept\nhis grip on the baliset.\n\u201cHow many men can you let Hawat have?\u201d the Duke asked.\n\u201cIs Thufir in trouble, Sire?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s lost only two agents, but his advance men gave us an excellent line\non the entire Harkonnen setup here. If we move fast we may gain a measure\nof security, the breathing space we require. He wants as many men as you\ncan spare\u2014men who won\u2019t balk at a little knife work.\u201d\n\u201cI can let him have three hundred of my best,\u201d Halleck said. \u201cWhere shall I\nsend them?\u201d\n\u201cTo the main gate. Hawat has an agent there waiting to take them.\u201d\n\u201cShall I get about it at once, Sire?\u201d\n\u201cIn a moment. We have another problem. The field commandant will hold\nthe shuttle here until dawn on a pretext. The Guild Heighliner that brought us\nis going on about its business, and the shuttle\u2019s supposed to make contact\nwith a cargo ship taking up a load of spice.\u201d\n\u201cOur spice, m\u2019Lord?\u201d\n\u201cOur spice. But the shuttle also will carry some of the spice hunters from\nthe old regime. They\u2019ve opted to leave with the change of fief and the Judge\nof the Change is allowing it. These are valuable workers, Gurney, about eight\nhundred of them. Before the shuttle leaves, you must persuade some of those\nmen to enlist with us.\u201d\n\u201cHow strong a persuasion, Sire?\u201d\n\u201cI want their willing cooperation, Gurney. Those men have experience and\nskills we need. The fact that they\u2019re leaving suggests they\u2019re not part of the\nHarkonnen machine. Hawat believes there could be some bad ones planted in\nthe group, but he sees assassins in every shadow.\u201d\n\u201cThufir has found some very productive shadows in his time, m\u2019Lord.\u201d\n\u201cAnd there are some he hasn\u2019t found. But I think planting sleepers in this\noutgoing crowd would show too much imagination for the Harkonnens.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly, Sire. Where are these men?\u201d\n\u201cDown on the lower level, in a waiting room. I suggest you go down and\nplay a tune or two to soften their minds, then turn on the pressure. You may\noffer positions of authority to those who qualify. Offer twenty per cent higher\nwages than they received under the Harkonnens.\u201d\n\u201cNo more than that, Sire? I know the Harkonnen pay scales. And to men\nwith their termination pay in their pockets and the wanderlust on them ...\nwell, Sire, twenty per cent would hardly seem proper inducement to stay.\u201d\nLeto spoke impatiently: \u201cThen use your own discretion in particular cases.\nJust remember that the treasury isn\u2019t bottomless. Hold it to twenty per cent\nwhenever you can. We particularly need spice drivers, weather scanners,\ndune men\u2014any with open sand experience.\u201d\n\u201cI understand, Sire. \u2018They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup\nup as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity of the sand.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cA very moving quotation,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cTurn your crew over to a\nlieutenant. Have him give a short drill on water discipline, then bed the men\ndown for the night in the barracks adjoining the field. Field personnel will\ndirect them. And don\u2019t forget the men for Hawat.\u201d\n\u201cThree hundred of the best, Sire.\u201d He took up his spacebag. \u201cWhere shall I\nreport to you when I\u2019ve completed my chores?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken over a council room topside here. We\u2019ll hold staff there. I want\nto arrange a new planetary dispersal order with armored squads going out\nfirst.\u201d\nHalleck stopped in the act of turning away, caught Leto\u2019s eye. \u201cAre you\nanticipating that kind of trouble, Sire? I thought there was a Judge of the\nChange here.\u201d\n\u201cBoth open battle and secret,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be blood aplenty\nspilled here before we\u2019re through.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018And the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood\nupon the dry land,\u2019 \u201d Halleck quoted.\nThe Duke sighed. \u201cHurry back, Gurney.\u201d\n\u201cVery good, m\u2018Lord.\u201d The whipscar rippled to his grin. \u201c\u2018Behold, as a\nwild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.\u2019\u201d He turned, strode to the center\nof the room, paused to relay his orders, hurried on through the men.\nLeto shook his head at the retreating back. Halleck was a continual\namazement\u2014a head full of songs, quotations, and flowery phrases ... and the\nheart of an assassin when it came to dealing with the Harkonnens.\nPresently, Leto took a leisurely diagonal course across to the lift,\nacknowledging salutes with a casual hand wave. He recognized a propaganda\ncorpsman, stopped to give him a message that could be relayed to the men\nthrough channels: those who had brought their women would want to know\nthe women were safe and where they could be found. The others would wish\nto know that the population here appeared to boast more women than men.\nThe Duke slapped the propaganda man on the arm, a signal that the\nmessage had top priority to be put out immediately, then continued across the\nroom. He nodded to the men, smiled, traded pleasantries with a subaltern.\nCommand must always look confident, he thought. All that faith riding on\nyour shoulders while you sit in the critical seat and never show it.\nHe breathed a sigh of relief when the lift swallowed him and he could turn\nand face the impersonal doors.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nOver the exit of the Arrakeen landing field, crudely carved\nas though with a poor instrument, there was an inscription that\nMuad\u2018Dib was to repeat many times. He saw it that first night\non Arrakis, having been brought to the ducal command post to\nparticipate in his father\u2019s first full staff conference. The words\nof the inscription were a plea to those leaving Arrakis, but they\nfell with dark import on the eyes of a boy who had just escaped\na close brush with death. They said: \u201cO you who know what we\nsuffer here, do not forget us in your prayers,\u201d\n\u2014from \u201cManual of Muad\u2019Dib\u201d by the Princess Irulan\n\u201cTHE WHOLE theory of warfare is calculated risk,\u201d the Duke said, \u201cbut\nwhen it comes to risking your own family, the element of calculation gets\nsubmerged in ... other things.\u201d\nHe knew he wasn\u2019t holding in his anger as well as he should, and he\nturned, strode down the length of the long table and back.\nThe Duke and Paul were alone in the conference room at the landing field.\nIt was an empty-sounding room, furnished only with the long table, old-\nfashioned three-legged chairs around it, and a map board and projector at one\nend. Paul sat at the table near the map board. He had told his father the\nexperience with the hunter-seeker and given the reports that a traitor\nthreatened him.\nThe Duke stopped across from Paul, pounded the table: \u201cHawat told me\nthat house was secure!\u201d\nPaul spoke hesitantly: \u201cI was angry, too\u2014at first. And I blamed Hawat.\nBut the threat came from outside the house. It was simple, clever, and direct.\nAnd it would\u2019ve succeeded were it not for the training given me by you and\nmany others\u2014including Hawat.\u201d\n\u201cAre you defending him?\u201d the Duke demanded.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s getting old. That\u2019s it. He should be\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s wise with much experience,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHow many of Hawat\u2019s\nmistakes can you recall?\u201d\n\u201cI should be the one defending him,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cNot you.\u201d\nPaul smiled.\nLeto sat down at the head of the table, put a hand over his son\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019ve\n... matured lately, Son.\u201d He lifted his hand. \u201cIt gladdens me.\u201d He matched his\nson\u2019s smile. \u201cHawat will punish himself. He\u2019ll direct more anger against\nhimself over this than both of us together could pour on him.\u201d\nPaul glanced toward the darkened windows beyond the map board, looked\nat the night\u2019s blackness. Room lights reflected from a balcony railing out\nthere. He saw movement and recognized the shape of a guard in Atreides\nuniform. Paul looked back at the white wall behind his father, then down to\nthe shiny surface of the table, seeing his own hands clenched into fists there.\nThe door opposite the Duke banged open. Thufir Hawat strode through it\nlooking older and more leathery than ever. He paced down the length of the\ntable, stopped at attention facing Leto.\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d he said, speaking to a point over Leto\u2019s head, \u201cI have just\nlearned how I failed you. It becomes necessary that I tender my resig\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, sit down and stop acting the fool,\u201d the Duke said. He waved to the\nchair across from Paul. \u201cIf you made a mistake, it was in overestimating the\nHarkonnens. Their simple minds came up with a simple trick. We didn\u2019t\ncount on simple tricks. And my son has been at great pains to point out to me\nthat he came through this largely because of your training. You didn\u2019t fail\nthere!\u201d He tapped the back of the empty chair. \u201cSit down, I say!\u201d\nHawat sank into the chair. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll hear no more of it,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cThe incident is past. We have\nmore pressing business. Where are the others?\u201d\n\u201cI asked them to wait outside while I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCall them in.\u201d\nHawat looked into Leto\u2019s eyes. \u201cSire, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know who my true friends are, Thufir,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cCall in the\nmen.\u201d\nHawat swallowed. \u201cAt once, my Lord.\u201d He swiveled in the chair, called to\nthe open door: \u201cGurney, bring them in.\u201d\nHalleck led the file of men into the room, the staff officers looking grimly\nserious followed by the younger aides and specialists, an air of eagerness\namong them. Brief scuffing sounds echoed around the room as the men took\nseats. A faint smell of rachag stimulant wafted down the table.\n\u201cThere\u2019s coffee for those who want it,\u201d the Duke said.\nHe looked over his men, thinking: They\u2019re a good crew. A man could do\nfar worse for this kind of war. He waited while coffee was brought in from\nthe adjoining room and served, noting the tiredness in some of the faces.\nPresently, he put on his mask of quiet efficiency, stood up and commanded\ntheir attention with a knuckle rap against the table.\n\u201cWell, gentlemen,\u201d he said, \u201cour civilization appears to\u2019ve fallen so deeply\ninto the habit of invasion that we cannot even obey a simple order of the\nImperium without the old ways cropping up.\u201d\nDry chuckles sounded around the table, and Paul realized that his father\nhad said the precisely correct thing in precisely the correct tone to lift the\nmood here. Even the hint of fatigue in his voice was right.\n\u201cI think first we\u2019d better learn if Thufir has anything to add to his report on\nthe Fremen,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cThufir?\u201d\nHawat glanced up. \u201cI\u2019ve some economic matters to go into after my\ngeneral report, Sire, but I can say now that the Fremen appear more and more\nto be the allies we need. They\u2019re waiting now to see if they can trust us, but\nthey appear to be dealing openly. They\u2019ve sent us a gift\u2014stillsuits of their\nown manufacture ... maps of certain desert areas surrounding strongpoints the\nHarkonnens left behind....\u201d He glanced down at the table.\u201cTheir intelligence\nreports have proved completely reliable and have helped us considerably in\nour dealings with the Judge of the Change. They\u2019ve also sent some incidental\nthings\u2014jewelry for the Lady Jessica, spice liquor, candy, medicinals. My\nmen are processing the lot right now. There appears to be no trickery.\u201d\n\u201cYou like these people, Thufir?\u201d asked a man down the table.\nHawat turned to face his questioner. \u201cDuncan Idaho says they\u2019re to be\nadmired.\u201d\nPaul glanced at his father, back to Hawat, ventured a question: \u201cHave you\nany new information on how many Fremen there are?\u201d\nHawat looked at Paul. \u201cFrom food processing and other evidence, Idaho\nestimates the cave complex he visited consisted of some ten thousand people,\nall told. Their leader said he ruled a sietch of two thousand hearths. We\u2019ve\nreason to believe there are a great many such sietch communities. All seem to\ngive their allegiance to someone called Liet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s something new,\u201d Leto said.\n\u201cIt could be an error on my part, Sire. There are things to suggest this Liet\nmay be a local diety.\u201d\nAnother man down the table cleared his throat, asked: \u201cIs it certain they\ndeal with the smugglers?\u201d\n\u201cA smuggler caravan left this sietch while Idaho was there, carrying a\nheavy load of spice. They used pack beasts and indicated they faced an\neighteen-day journey.\u201d\n\u201cIt appears,\u201d the Duke said, \u201cthat the smugglers have redoubled their\noperations during this period of unrest. This deserves some careful thought.\nWe shouldn\u2019t worry too much about unlicensed frigates working off our\nplanet\u2014it\u2019s always done. But to have them completely outside our\nobservation\u2014that\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a plan, Sire,\u201d Hawat asked.\nThe Duke looked at Halleck. \u201cGurney, I want you to head a delegation, an\nembassy if you will, to contact these romantic businessmen. Tell them I\u2019ll\nignore their operations as long as they give me a ducal tithe. Hawat here\nestimates that graft and extra fighting men heretofore required in their\noperations have been costing them four times that amount.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if the Emperor gets wind of this?\u201d Halleck asked. \u201cHe\u2019s very\njealous of his CHOAM profits, m\u2019Lord.\u201d\nLeto smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll bank the entire tithe openly in the name of Shaddam\nIV and deduct it legally from our levy support costs. Let the Harkonnens\nfight that! And we\u2019ll be ruining a few more of the locals who grew fat under\nthe Harkonnen system. No more graft!\u201d\nA grin twisted Halleck\u2019s face. \u201cAhh, m\u2019Lord, a beautiful low blow. Would\nthat I could see the Baron\u2019s face when he learns of this.\u201d\nThe Duke turned to Hawat. \u201cThufir, did you get those account books you\nsaid you could buy?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my Lord. They\u2019re being examined in detail even now. I\u2019ve skimmed\nthem, though, and can give a first approximation.\u201d\n\u201cGive it, then.\u201d\n\u201cThe Harkonnens took ten billion solaris out of here every three hundred\nand thirty Standard days.\u201d\nA muted gasp ran around the table. Even the younger aides, who had been\nbetraying some boredom, sat up straighter and exchanged wide-eyed looks.\nHalleck murmured: \u201c\u2018For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and\nof the treasure hid in the sand.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cYou see, gentlemen,\u201d Leto said. \u201cIs there anyone here so naive he\nbelieves the Harkonnens have quietly packed up and walked away from all\nthis merely because the Emperor ordered it?\u201d\nThere was a general shaking of heads, murmurous agreement.\n\u201cWe will have to take it at the point of the sword,\u201d Leto said. He turned to\nHawat. \u201cThis\u2019d be a good point to report on equipment. How many\nsandcrawlers, harvesters, spice factories, and supporting equipment have they\nleft us?\u201d\n\u201cA full complement, as it says in the Imperial inventory audited by the\nJudge of the Change, my Lord,\u201d Hawat said. He gestured for an aide to pass\nhim a folder, opened the folder on the table in front of him. \u201cThey neglect to\nmention that less than half the crawlers are operable, that only about a third\nhave carryalls to fly them to spice sands\u2014that everything the Harkonnens left\nus is ready to break down and fall apart. We\u2019ll be lucky to get half the\nequipment into operation and luckier yet if a fourth of it\u2019s still working six\nmonths from now.\u201d\n\u201cPretty much as we expected,\u201d Leto said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the firm estimate on\nbasic equipment?\u201d\nHawat glanced at his folder. \u201cAbout nine hundred and thirty harvester-\nfactories that can be sent out in a few days. About sixty-two hundred and fifty\nornithopters for survey, scouting, and weather observation ... carryalls, a little\nunder a thousand.\u201d\nHalleck said: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cheaper to reopen negotiations with the\nGuild for permission to orbit a frigate as a weather satellite?\u201d\nThe Duke looked at Hawat. \u201cNothing new there, eh, Thufir?\u201d\n\u201cWe must pursue other avenues for now,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cThe Guild agent\nwasn\u2019t really negotiating with us. He was merely making it plain\u2014one\nMentat to another\u2014that the price was out of our reach and would remain so\nno matter how long a reach we develop. Our task is to find out why before we\napproach him again.\u201d\nOne of Halleck\u2019s aides down the table swiveled in his chair, snapped:\n\u201cThere\u2019s no justice in this!\u201d\n\u201cJustice?\u201d The Duke looked at the man. \u201cWho asks for justice? We make\nour own justice. We make it here on Arrakis\u2014win or die. Do you regret\ncasting your lot with us, sir?\u201d\nThe man stared at the Duke, then: \u201cNo, Sire. You couldn\u2019t turn and I could\ndo nought but follow you. Forgive the outburst, but....\u201d He shrugged. \u201c... we\nmust all feel bitter at times.\u201d\n\u201cBitterness I understand,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cBut let us not rail about justice\nas long as we have arms and the freedom to use them. Do any of the rest of\nyou harbor bitterness? If so, let it out. This is friendly council where any man\nmay speak his mind.\u201d\nHalleck stirred, said: \u201cI think what rankles, Sire, is that we\u2019ve had no\nvolunteers from the other Great Houses. They address you as \u2018Leto the Just\u2019\nand promise eternal friendship, but only as long as it doesn\u2019t cost them\nanything.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know yet who\u2019s going to win this exchange,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cMost of the Houses have grown fat by taking few risks. One cannot truly\nblame them for this; one can only despise them.\u201d He looked at Hawat. \u201cWe\nwere discussing equipment. Would you care to project a few examples to\nfamiliarize the men with this machinery?\u201d\nHawat nodded, gestured to an aide at the projector.\nA solido tri-D projection appeared on the table surface about a third of the\nway down from the Duke. Some of the men farther along the table stood up\nto get a better look at it.\nPaul leaned forward, staring at the machine.\nScaled against the tiny projected human figures around it, the thing was\nabout one hundred and twenty meters long and about forty meters wide. It\nwas basically a long, buglike body moving on independent sets of wide\ntracks.\n\u201cThis is a harvester factory,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cWe chose one in good repair for\nthis projection. There\u2019s one dragline outfit that came in with the first team of\nImperial ecologists, though, and it\u2019s still running ... although I don\u2019t know\nhow ... or why.\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the one they call \u2018Old Maria,\u2019 it belongs in a museum,\u201d an aide\nsaid. \u201cI think the Harkonnens kept it as a punishment job, a threat hanging\nover their workers\u2019 heads. Be good or you\u2019ll be assigned to Old Maria.\u201d\nChuckles sounded around the table.\nPaul held himself apart from the humor, his attention focused on the\nprojection and the question that filled his mind. He pointed to the image on\nthe table, said: \u201cThufir, are there sandworms big enough to swallow that\nwhole?\u201d\nQuick silence settled on the table. The Duke cursed under his breath, then\nthought: No\u2014they have tofacethe realities here.\n\u201cThere\u2019re worms in the deep desert could take this entire factory in one\ngulp,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cUp here closer to the Shield Wall where most of the\nspicing\u2019s done there are plenty of worms that could cripple this factory and\ndevour it at their leisure.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we shield them?\u201d Paul asked.\n\u201cAccording to Idaho\u2019s report,\u201d Hawat said, \u201cshields are dangerous in the\ndesert. A body-size shield will call every worm for hundreds of meters\naround. It appears to drive them into a killing frenzy. We\u2019ve the Fremen word\non this and no reason to doubt it. Idaho saw no evidence of shield equipment\nat the sietch.\u201d\n\u201cNone at all?\u201d Paul asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019d be pretty hard to conceal that kind of thing among several thousand\npeople,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cIdaho had free access to every part of the sietch. He\nsaw no shields or any indication of their use.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cThe Harkonnens certainly used plenty of shields here,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cThey\nhad repair depots in every garrison village, and their accounts show a heavy\nexpenditure for shield replacements and parts.\u201d\n\u201cCould the Fremen have a way of nullifying shields?\u201d Paul asked.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem likely,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cIt\u2019s theoretically possible, of course\n\u2014a shire-sized static counter charge is supposed to do the trick, but no one\u2019s\never been able to put it to the test.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d have heard about it before now,\u201d Halleck said. \u201cThe smugglers\nhave close contact with the Fremen and would\u2019ve acquired such a device if it\nwere available. And they\u2019d have had no inhibitions against marketing it off\nplanet.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like an unanswered question of this importance,\u201d Leto said.\n\u201cThufir, I want you to give top priority to solution of this problem.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re already working on it, my Lord.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cAh-h,\nIdaho did say one thing: he said you couldn\u2019t mistake the Fremen attitude\ntoward shields. He said they were mostly amused by them.\u201d\nThe Duke frowned, then: \u201cThe subject under discussion is spicing\nequipment.\u201d\nHawat gestured to his aide at the projector.\nThe solido-image of the harvester-factory was replaced by a projection of a\nwinged device that dwarfed the images of human figures around it. \u201cThis is a\ncarryall,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a large \u2018thopter, whose sole function is\nto deliver a factory to spice-rich sands, then to rescue the factory when a\nsandworm appears. They always appear. Harvesting the spice is a process of\ngetting in and getting out with as much as possible.\u201d\n\u201cAdmirably suited to Harkonnen morality,\u201d the Duke said.\nLaughter was abrupt and too loud.\nAn ornithopter replaced the carryall in the projection focus.\n\u201cThese \u2018thopters are fairly conventional,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cMajor\nmodifications give them extended range. Extra care has been used in sealing\nessential areas against sand and dust. Only about one in thirty is shielded\u2014\npossibly discarding the shield generator\u2019s weight for greater range.\u201d\n"
