    "userPrompt": "believes he\u2019s given the Duke your spice planet. How poignant.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nonsensical statement,\u201d the Baron rumbled. \u201cYou say this to\nconfuse young Feyd-Rautha, but it is not necessary to confuse my nephew.\u201d\nThe sullen-faced youth stirred in his chair, smoothed a wrinkle in the black\nleotards he wore. He sat upright as a discreet tapping sounded at the door in\nthe wall behind him.\nPiter unfolded from his chair, crossed to the door, cracked it wide enough\nto accept a message cylinder. He closed the door, unrolled the cylinder and\nscanned it. A chuckle sounded from him. Another.\n\u201cWell?\u201d the Baron demanded.\n\u201cThe fool answered us, Baron!\u201d\n\u201cWhenever did an Atreides refuse the opportunity for a gesture?\u201d the\nBaron asked. \u201cWell, what does he say?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s most uncouth, Baron. Addresses you as \u2018Harkonnen\u2019-no \u2018Sire et\nCher Cousin,\u2019 no title, nothing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good name,\u201d the Baron growled, and his voice betrayed his\nimpatience. \u201cWhat does dear Leto say?\u201d\n\u201cHe says: \u2018Your offer of a meeting is refused. I have ofttimes met your\ntreachery and this all men know.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d the Baron asked.\n\u201cHe says: \u2018The art of kanly still has admirers in the Empire.\u2019 He signs it:\n\u2018Duke Leto of Arrakis.\u2019 \u201d Piter began to laugh. \u201cOf Arrakis! Oh, my! This is\nalmost too rich!\u201d\n\u201cBe silent, Piter,\u201d the Baron said, and the laughter stopped as though shut\noff with a switch. \u201cKanly, is it?\u201d the Baron asked. \u201cVendetta, heh? And he\nuses the nice old word so rich in tradition to be sure I know he means it.\u201d\n\u201cYou made the peace gesture,\u201d Piter said. \u201cThe forms have been obeyed.\u201d\n\u201cFor a Mentat, you talk too much, Piter,\u201d the Baron said. And he thought: I\nmust do away with that one soon. He has almost outlived his usefulness. The\nBaron stared across the room at his Mentat assassin, seeing the feature about\nhim that most people noticed first: the eyes, the shaded slits of blue within\nblue, the eyes without any white in them at all.\nA grin flashed across Piter\u2019s face. It was like a mask grimace beneath those\neyes like holes. \u201cBut, Baron! Never has revenge been more beautiful. It is to\nsee a plan of the most exquisite treachery: to make Leto exchange Caladan\nfor Dune\u2014and without alternative because the Emperor orders it. How\nwaggish of you!\u201d\nIn a cold voice, the Baron said: \u201cYou have a flux of the mouth, Piter.\u201d\n\u201cBut I am happy, my Baron. Whereas you ... you are touched by jealousy.\u201d\n\u201cPiter!\u201d\n\u201cAh-ah, Baron! Is it not regrettable you were unable to devise this\ndelicious scheme by yourself?\u201d\n\u201cSomeday I will have you strangled, Piter.\u201d\n\u201cOf a certainty, Baron. Enfin! But a kind act is never lost, eh?\u201d\n\u201cHave you been chewing verite or semuta, Piter?\u201d\n\u201cTruth without fear surprises the Baron,\u201d Piter said. His face drew down\ninto a caricature of a frowning mask. \u201cAh, hah! But you see, Baron, I know\nas a Mentat when you will send the executioner. You will hold back just so\nlong as I am useful. To move sooner would be wasteful and I\u2019m yet of much\nuse. I know what it is you learned from that lovely Dune planet\u2014waste not.\nTrue, Baron?\u201d\nThe Baron continued to stare at Piter.\nFeyd-Rautha squirmed in his chair. These wrangling fools! he thought. My\nuncle cannot talk to his Mentat without arguing. Do they think I\u2019ve nothing to\ndo except listen to their arguments?\n\u201cFeyd,\u201d the Baron said. \u201cI told you to listen and learn when I invited you in\nhere. Are you learning?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Uncle.\u201d the voice was carefully subservient.\n\u201cSometimes I wonder about Piter,\u201d the Baron said. \u201cI cause pain out of\nnecessity, but he ... I swear he takes a positive delight in it. For myself, I can\nfeel pity toward the poor Duke Leto. Dr. Yueh will move against him soon,\nand that\u2019ll be the end of all the Atreides. But surely Leto will know whose\nhand directed the pliant doctor ... and knowing that will be a terrible thing.\u201d\n\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you directed the doctor to slip a kindjal between his\nribs quietly and efficiently?\u201d Piter asked. \u201cYou talk of pity, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe Duke must know when I encompass his doom,\u201d the Baron said. \u201cAnd\nthe other Great Houses must learn of it. The knowledge will give them pause.\nI\u2019ll gain a bit more room to maneuver. The necessity is obvious, but I don\u2019t\nhave to like it.\u201d\n\u201cRoom to maneuver,\u201d Piter sneered. \u201cAlready you have the Emperor\u2019s\neyes on you, Baron. You move too boldly. One day the Emperor will send a\nlegion or two of his Sardaukar down here onto Giedi Prime and that\u2019ll be an\nend to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d like to see that, wouldn\u2019t you, Piter?\u201d the Baron asked. \u201cYou\u2019d\nenjoy seeing the Corps of Sardaukar pillage through my cities and sack this\ncastle. You\u2019d truly enjoy that.\u201d\n\u201cDoes the Baron need to ask?\u201d Piter whispered.\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve been a Bashar of the Corps,\u201d the Baron said. \u201cYou\u2019re too\ninterested in blood and pain. Perhaps I was too quick with my promise of the\nspoils of Arrakis.\u201d\nPiter took five curiously mincing steps into the room, stopped directly\nbehind Feyd-Rautha. There was a tight air of tension in the room, and the\nyouth looked up at Piter with a worried frown.\n\u201cDo not toy with Piter, Baron,\u201d Piter said. \u201cYou promised me the Lady\nJessica. You promised her to me.\u201d\n\u201cFor what, Piter?\u201d the Baron asked. \u201cFor pain?\u201d\nPiter stared at him, dragging out the silence.\nFeyd-Rautha moved his suspensor chair to one side, said: \u201cUncle, do I\nhave to stay? You said you\u2019d\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy darling Feyd-Rautha grows impatient,\u201d the Baron said. He moved\nwithin the shadows beside the globe. \u201cPatience, Feyd.\u201d And he turned his\nattention back to the Mentat. \u201cWhat of the Dukeling, the child Paul, my dear\nPiter?\u201d\n\u201cThe trap will bring him to you, Baron,\u201d Piter muttered.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my question,\u201d the Baron said. \u201cYou\u2019ll recall that you predicted\nthe Bene Gesserit witch would bear a daughter to the Duke. You were wrong,\neh, Mentat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not often wrong, Baron,\u201d Piter said, and for the first time there was\nfear in his voice. \u201cGive me that: I\u2019m not often wrong. And you know yourself\nthese Bene Gesserit bear mostly daughters. Even the Emperor\u2019s consort had\nproduced only females.\u201d\n\u201cUncle,\u201d said Feyd-Rautha, \u201cyou said there\u2019d be something important here\nfor me to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen to my nephew,\u201d the Baron said. \u201cHe aspires to rule my Barony, yet\nhe cannot rule himself.\u201d The Baron stirred beside the globe, a shadow among\nshadows. \u201cWell then, Feyd-Rautha Harkonne, I summoned you here hoping\nto teach you a bit of wisdom. Have you observed our good Mentat? You\nshould\u2019ve learned something from this exchange.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Uncle\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA most efficient Mentat, Piter, wouldn\u2019t you say, Feyd?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAh! Indeed but! But he consumes too much spice, eats it like candy. Look\nat his eyes! He might\u2019ve come directly from the Arrakeen labor pool.\nEfficient, Piter, but he\u2019s still emotional and prone to passionate outbursts.\nEfficient, Piter, but he still can err.\u201d\nPiter spoke in a low, sullen tone: \u201cDid you call me in here to impair my\nefficiency with criticism, Baron?\u201d\n\u201cImpair your efficiency? You know me better, Piter. I wish only for my\nnephew to understand the limitations of a Mentat.\u201d\n\u201cAre you already training my replacement?\u201d Piter demanded.\n\u201cReplace you? Why, Piter, where could I find another Mentat with your\ncunning and venom?\u201d\n\u201cThe same place you found me, Baron.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps I should at that,\u201d the Baron mused. \u201cYou do seem a bit unstable\nlately. And the spice you eat!\u201d\n\u201cAre my pleasures too expensive, Baron? Do you object to them?\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Piter, your pleasures are what tie you to me. How could I object\nto that? I merely wish my nephew to observe this about you.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019m on display,\u201d Piter said. \u201cShall I dance? Shall I perform my\nvarious functions for the eminent Feyd-Rau\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d the Baron said. \u201cYou are on display. Now, be silent.\u201d He\nglanced at Feyd-Rautha, noting his nephew\u2019s lips, the full and pouting look\nof them, the Harkonnen genetic marker, now twisted slightly in amusement.\n\u201cThis is a Mentat, Feyd. It has been trained and conditioned to perform\ncertain duties. The fact that it\u2019s encased in a human body, however, must not\nbe overlooked. A serious drawback, that. I sometimes think the ancients with\ntheir thinking machines had the right idea.\u201d\n\u201cThey were toys compared to me,\u201d Piter snarled. \u201cYou yourself, Baron,\ncould outperform those machines.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d the Baron said. \u201cAh, well....\u201d He took a deep breath, belched.\n\u201cNow, Piter, outline for my nephew the salient features of our campaign\nagainst the House of Atreides. Function as a Mentat for us, if you please.\u201d\n\u201cBaron, I\u2019ve warned you not to trust one so young with this information.\nMy observations of\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of this,\u201d the Baron said. \u201cI give you an order, Mentat.\nPerform one of your various functions.\u201d\n\u201cSo be it,\u201d Piter said. He straightened, assuming an odd attitude of dignity\n\u2014as though it were another mask, but this time clothing his entire body. \u201cIn a\nfew days Standard, the entire household of the Duke Leto will embark on a\nSpacing Guild liner for Arrakis. The Guild will deposit them at the city of\nArrakeen rather than at our city of Carthag. The Duke\u2019s Mentat, Thufir\nHawat, will have concluded rightly that Arrakeen is easier to defend.\u201d\n\u201cListen carefully, Feyd,\u201d the Baron said. \u201cObserve the plans within plans\nwithin plans.\u201d\nFeyd-Rautha nodded, thinking: This is more like it. The old monster is\nletting me in on secret things at last. He must really mean for me to be his\nheir.\n\u201cThere are several tangential possibilities,\u201d Piter said. \u201cI indicate that\nHouse Atreides will go to Arrakis. We must not, however, ignore the\npossibility the Duke has contracted with the Guild to remove him to a place\nof safety outside the System. Others in like circumstances have become\nrenegade Houses, taking family atomics and shields and fleeing beyond the\nImperium.\u201d\n\u201cThe Duke\u2019s too proud a man for that,\u201d the Baron said.\n\u201cIt is a possibility,\u201d Piter said. \u201cThe ultimate effect for us would be the\nsame, however.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it would not!\u201d the Baron growled. \u201cI must have him dead and his line\nended.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the high probability,\u201d Piter said. \u201cThere are certain preparations\nthat indicate when a House is going renegade. The Duke appears to be doing\nnone of these things.\u201d\n\u201cSo,\u201d the Baron sighed. \u201cGet on with it, Piter.\n\u201cAt Arrakeen,\u201d Piter said, \u201cthe Duke and his family will occupy the\nResidency, lately the home of Count and Lady Fenring.\u201d\n\u201cThe Ambassador to the Smugglers,\u201d the Baron chuckled.\n\u201cAmbassador to what?\u201d Feyd-Rautha asked.\n\u201cYour uncle makes a joke,\u201d Piter said. \u201cHe calls Count Fenring\nAmbassador to the Smugglers, indicating the Emperor\u2019s interest in smuggling\noperations on Arrakis.\u201d\nFeyd-Rautha turned a puzzled stare on his uncle. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be dense, Feyd,\u201d the Baron snapped. \u201cAs long as the Guild remains\neffectively outside Imperial control, how could it be otherwise? How else\ncould spies and assassins move about?\u201d\nFeyd-Rautha\u2019s mouth made a soundless \u201cOh-h-h-h.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve arranged diversions at the Residency,\u201d Piter said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be an\nattempt on the life of the Atreides heir\u2014an attempt which could succeed.\u201d\n\u201cPiter,\u201d the Baron rumbled, \u201cyou indicated\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI indicated accidents can happen,\u201d Piter said. \u201cAnd the attempt must\nappear valid.\u201d\n\u201cAh, but the lad has such a sweet young body,\u201d the Baron said. \u201cOf course,\nhe\u2019s potentially more dangerous than the father ... with that witch mother\ntraining him. Accursed woman! Ah, well, please continue, Piter.\u201d\n\u201cHawat will have divined that we have an agent planted on him,\u201d Piter\nsaid. \u201cThe obvious suspect is Dr. Yueh, who is indeed our agent. But Hawat\nhas investigated and found that our doctor is a Suk School graduate with\nImperial Conditioning\u2014supposedly safe enough to minister even to the\nEmperor. Great store is set on Imperial Conditioning. It\u2019s assumed that\nultimate conditioning cannot be removed without killing the subject.\nHowever, as someone once observed, given the right lever you can move a\nplanet. We found the lever that moved the doctor.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d Feyd-Rautha asked. He found this a fascinating subject. Everyone\nknew you couldn\u2019t subvert Imperial Conditioning!\n\u201cAnother time,\u201d the Baron said. \u201cContinue, Piter.\u201d\n\u201cIn place of Yueh,\u201d Piter said, \u201cwe\u2019ll drag a most interesting suspect across\nHawat\u2019s path. The very audacity of this suspect will recommend her to\nHawat\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\u201cHer?\u201d Feyd-Rautha asked.\n\u201cThe Lady Jessica herself,\u201d the Baron said.\n\u201cIs it not sublime?\u201d Piter asked. \u201cHawat\u2019s mind will be so filled with this\nprospect it\u2019ll impair his function as a Mentat. He may even try to kill her.\u201d\nPiter frowned, then: \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to carry it off.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want him to, eh?\u201d the Baron asked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t distract me,\u201d Piter said. \u201cWhile Hawat\u2019s occupied with the Lady\nJessica, we\u2019ll divert him further with uprisings in a few garrison towns and\nthe like. These will be put down. The Duke must believe he\u2019s gaining a\nmeasure of security. Then, when the moment is ripe, we\u2019ll signal Yueh and\nmove in with our major force ... ah....\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead, tell him all of it,\u201d the Baron said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll move in strengthened by two legions of Sardaukar disguised in\nHarkonnen livery.\u201d\n\u201cSardaukar!\u201d Feyd-Rautha breathed. His mind focused on the dread\nImperial troops, the killers without mercy, the soldier-fanatics of the Padishah\nEmperor.\n\u201cYou see how I trust you, Feyd,\u201d the Baron said. \u201cNo hint of this must ever\nreach another Great House, else the Landsraad might unite against the\nImperial House and there\u2019d be chaos.\u201d\n\u201cThe main point,\u201d Piter said, \u201cis this: since House Harkonnen is being used\nto do the Imperial dirty work, we\u2019ve gained a true advantage. It\u2019s a dangerous\nadvantage, to be sure, but if used cautiously, will bring House Harkonnen\ngreater wealth than that of any other House in the Imperium.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no idea how much wealth is involved, Feyd,\u201d the Baron said.\n\u201cNot in your wildest imaginings. To begin, we\u2019ll have an irrevocable\ndirectorship in the CHOAM Company.\u201d\nFeyd-Rautha nodded. Wealth was the thing. CHOAM was the key to\nwealth, each noble House dipping from the company\u2019s coffers whatever it\ncould under the power of the directorships. Those CHOAM directorships\u2014\nthey were the real evidence of political power in the Imperium, passing with\nthe shifts of voting strength within the Landsraad as it balanced itself against\nthe Emperor and his supporters.\n\u201cThe Duke Leto,\u201d Piter said, \u201cmay attempt to flee to the new Fremen scum\nalong the desert\u2019s edge. Or he may try to send his family into that imagined\nsecurity. But that path is blocked by one of His Majesty\u2019s agents\u2014the\nplanetary ecologist. You may remember him\u2014Kynes.\u201d\n\u201cFeyd remembers him,\u201d the Baron said. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not drool very prettily, Baron,\u201d Piter said.\n\u201cGet on with it, I command you!\u201d the Baron roared.\nPiter shrugged. \u201cIf matters go as planned,\u201d he said, \u201cHouse Harkonnen will\nhave a subfief on Arrakis within a Standard year. Your uncle will have\ndispensation of that fief. His own personal agent will rule on Arrakis.\u201d\n\u201cMore profits,\u201d Feyd-Rautha said.\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d the Baron said. And he thought: It\u2019s only just. We\u2019re the ones\nwho tamed Arrakis ... except for the few mongrel Fremen hiding in the skirts\nof the desert ... and some tame smugglers bound to the planet almost as\ntightly as the native laborpool.\n\u201cAnd the Great Houses will know that the Baron has destroyed the\nAtreides,\u201d Piter said. \u201cThey will know.\u201d\n\u201cThey will know,\u201d the Baron breathed.\n\u201cLoveliest of all,\u201d Piter said, \u201cis that the Duke will know, too. He knows\nnow. He can already feel the trap.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true the Duke knows,\u201d the Baron said, and his voice held a note of\nsadness. \u201cHe could not help but know ... more\u2019s the pity.\u201d\nThe Baron moved out and away from the globe of Arrakis. As he emerged\nfrom the shadows, his figure took on dimension\u2014grossly and immensely fat.\nAnd with subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this\nfat was sustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh. He\nmight weigh two hundred Standard kilos in actuality, but his feet would carry\nno more than fifty of them.\n\u201cI am hungry,\u201d the Baron rumbled, and he rubbed his protruding lips with\na beringed hand, stared down at Feyd-Rautha through fat-enfolded eyes.\n\u201cSend for food, my darling. We will eat before we retire.\u201d\nThus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: \u201cThe Reverend Mother\nmust combine the seductive wiles of acourtesan with the\nuntouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these\nattributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure.\nFor when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the\nplace-between, once occupied by tension, has become a well-\nspring of cunning and resourcefulness.\u201d\n\u2014from\u201cMuad\u2019Dib, Family Commentaries\u201d by the Princess Irulan\n\u201cWELL, JESSICA, what have you to say for yourself?\u201d asked the\nReverend Mother.\nIt was near sunset at Castle Caladan on the day of Paul\u2019s ordeal. The two\nwomen were alone in Jessica\u2019s morning room while Paul waited in the\nadjoining soundproofed Meditation Chamber.\nJessica stood facing the south windows. She saw and yet did not see the\nevening\u2019s banked colors across meadow and river. She heard and yet did not\nhear the Reverend Mother\u2019s question.\nThere had been another ordeal once\u2014so many years ago. A skinny girl\nwith hair the color of bronze, her body tortured by the winds of puberty, had\nentered the study of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Proctor\nSuperior of the Bene Gesserit school on Wallach IX. Jessica looked down at\nher right hand, flexed the fingers, remembering the pain, the terror, the anger.\n\u201cPoor Paul,\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cI asked you a question, Jessica!\u201d The old woman\u2019s voice was snappish,\ndemanding.\n\u201cWhat? Oh....\u201d Jessica tore her attention away from the past, faced the\nReverend Mother, who sat with back to the stone wall between the two west\nwindows. \u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do I want you to say? What do I want you to say?\u201d The old voice\ncarried a tone of cruel mimicry.\n\u201cSo I had a son!\u201d Jessica flared. And she knew she was being goaded into\nthis anger deliberately.\n\u201cYou were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides.\u201d\n\u201cIt meant so much to him,\u201d Jessica pleaded.\n\u201cAnd you in your pride thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach!\u201d\nJessica lifted her chin. \u201cI sensed the possibility.\u201d\n\u201cYou thought only of your Duke\u2019s desire for a son,\u201d the old woman\nsnapped. \u201cAnd his desires don\u2019t figure in this. An Atreides daughter could\u2019ve\nbeen wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. You\u2019ve hopelessly\ncomplicated matters. We may lose both bloodlines now.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not infallible,\u201d Jessica said. She braved the steady stare from the\nold eyes.\nPresently, the old woman muttered: \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done.\u201d\n\u201cI vowed never to regret my decision,\u201d Jessica said.\n\u201cHow noble,\u201d the Reverend Mother sneered. \u201cNo regrets. We shall see\nwhen you\u2019re a fugitive with a price on your head and every man\u2019s hand\nturned against you to seek your life and the life of your son.\u201d\nJessica paled. \u201cIs there no alternative?\u201d\n\u201cAlternative? A Bene Gesserit should ask that?\u201d\n\u201cI ask only what you see in the future with your superior abilities.\u201d\n\u201cI see in the future what I\u2019ve seen in the past. You well know the pattern of\nour affairs, Jessica. The race knows its own mortality and fears stagnation of\nits heredity. It\u2019s in the bloodstream\u2014the urge to mingle genetic strains\nwithout plan. The Imperium, the CHOAM Company, all the Great Houses,\nthey are but bits of flotsam in the path of the flood.\u201d\n\u201cCHOAM,\u201d Jessica muttered. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s already decided how they\u2019ll\nredivide the spoils of Arrakis.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is CHOAM but the weather vane of our times,\u201d the old woman said.\n\u201cThe Emperor and his friends now command fifty-nine point six-five per cent\nof the CHOAM directorship\u2019s votes. Certainly they smell profits, and likely\nas others smell those same profits his voting strength will increase. This is the\npattern of history, girl.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly what I need right now,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cA review of\nhistory.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be facetious, girl! You know as well as I do what forces surround\nus. We\u2019ve a three-point civilization: the Imperial Household balanced against\nthe Federated Great Houses of the Landsraad, and between them, the Guild\nwith its damnable monopoly on interstellar transport. In politics, the tripod is\nthe most unstable of all structures. It\u2019d be bad enough without the\ncomplication of a feudal trade culture which turns its back on most science.\u201d\nJessica spoke bitterly: \u201cChips in the path of the flood\u2014and this chip here,\nthis is the Duke Leto, and this one\u2019s his son, and this one\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, shut up, girl. You entered this with full knowledge of the delicate\nedge you walked.\u201d\n\u201c \u2018I am Bene Gesserit: I exist only to serve,\u2019 \u201d Jessica quoted.\n\u201cTruth,\u201d the old woman said. \u201cAnd all we can hope for now is to prevent\n"
