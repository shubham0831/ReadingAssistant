    "userPrompt": "the spirit that can be conceived. He took a deep breath, feeling rage tighten\nhis stomach.\n\u201cThe custom stops here!\u201d he muttered.\nHe saw a serving woman\u2014one of the old and gnarled ones the\nhousekeeper had recommended\u2014hovering at the doorway from the kitchen\nacross from him. The Duke signaled with upraised hand. She moved out of\nthe shadows, scurried around the table toward him, and he noted the leathery\nface, the blue-within-blue eyes.\n\u201cMy Lord wishes?\u201d She kept her head bowed, eyes shielded.\nHe gestured. \u201cHave these basins and towels removed.\u201d\n\u201cBut... Noble Born....\u201d She looked up, mouth gaping.\n\u201cI know the custom!\u201d he barked. \u201cTake these basins to the front door.\nWhile we\u2019re eating and until we\u2019ve finished, each beggar who calls may have\na full cup of water. Understood?\u201d\nHer leathery face displayed a twisting of emotions: dismay, anger....\nWith sudden insight, Leto realized that she must have planned to sell the\nwater squeezings from the foot-trampled towels, wringing a few coppers\nfrom the wretches who came to the door. Perhaps that also was a custom.\nHis face clouded, and he growled: \u201cI\u2019m posting a guard to see that my\norders are carried out to the letter.\u201d\nHe whirled, strode back down the passage to the Great Hall. Memories\nrolled in his mind like the toothless mutterings of old women. He\nremembered open water and waves\u2014days of grass instead of sand\u2014dazed\nsummers that had whipped past him like windstorm leaves.\nAll gone.\nI\u2019m getting old, he thought. I\u2019ve felt the cold hand of my mortality. And in\nwhat? An old woman\u2019s greed.\nIn the Great Hall, the Lady Jessica was the center of a mixed group\nstanding in front of the fireplace. An open blaze crackled there, casting\nflickers of orange light onto jewels and laces and costly fabrics. He\nrecognized in the group a stillsuit manufacturer down from Carthag, an\nelectronics equipment importer, a watershipper whose summer mansion was\nnear his polar-cap factory, a representative of the Guild Bank (lean and\nremote, that one), a dealer in replacement parts for spice mining equipment, a\nthin and hard-faced woman whose escort service for off-planet visitors\nreputedly operated as cover for various smuggling, spying, and blackmail\noperations.\nMost of the women in the hall seemed cast from a specific type\u2014\ndecorative, precisely turned out, an odd mingling of untouchable\nsensuousness.\nEven without her position as hostess, Jessica would have dominated the\ngroup, he thought. She wore no jewelry and had chosen warm colors\u2014a long\ndress almost the shade of the open blaze, and an earth-brown band around her\nbronzed hair.\nHe realized she had done this to taunt him subtly, a reproof against his\nrecent pose of coldness. She was well aware that he liked her best in these\nshades\u2014that he saw her as a rustling of warm colors.\nNearby, more an outflanker than a member of the group, stood Duncan\nIdaho in glittering dress uniform, flat face unreadable, the curling black hair\nneatly combed. He had been summoned back from the Fremen and had his\norders from Hawat\u2014\u201cUnder pretext of guarding her, you will keep the Lady\nJessica under constant surveillance. \u201d\nThe Duke glanced around the room.\nThere was Paul in the corner surrounded by a fawning group of the\nyounger Arrakeen richece, and, aloof among them, three officers of the\nHouse Troop. The Duke took particular note of the young women. What a\ncatch a ducal heir would make. But Paul was treating all equally with an air\nof reserved nobility.\nHe\u2019ll wear the title well, the Duke thought, and realized with a sudden chill\nthat this was another death thought.\nPaul saw his father in the doorway, avoided his eyes. He looked around at\nthe clusterings of guests, the jeweled hands clutching drinks (and the\nunobtrusive inspections with tiny remote-cast snoopers). Seeing all the\nchattering faces, Paul was suddenly repelled by them. They were cheap\nmasks locked on festering thoughts\u2014voices gabbling to drown out the loud\nsilence in every breast.\nI\u2019m in a sour mood, he thought, and wondered what Gurney would say to\nthat.\nHe knew his mood\u2019s source. He hadn\u2019t wanted to attend this function, but\nhis father had been firm. \u201cYou have a place\u2014a position to uphold. You\u2019re\nold enough to do this. You\u2019re almost a man.\u201d\nPaul saw his father emerge from the doorway, inspect the room, then cross\nto the group around the Lady Jessica.\nAs Leto approached Jessica\u2019s group, the water-shipper was asking: \u201cIs it\ntrue the Duke will put in weather control?\u201d\nFrom behind the man, the Duke said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone that far in our\nthinking, sir.\u201d\nThe man turned, exposing a bland round face, darkly tanned. \u201cAh-h, the\nDuke,\u201d he said. \u201cWe missed you.\u201d\nLeto glanced at Jessica. \u201cA thing needed doing.\u201d He returned his attention\nto the water-shipper, explained what he had ordered for the laving basins,\nadding: \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, the old custom ends now.\u201d\n\u201cIs this a ducal order, m\u2019Lord?\u201d the man asked.\n\u201cI leave that to your own... ah ... conscience,\u201d the Duke said. He turned,\nnoting Kynes come up to the group.\nOne of the women said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a very generous gesture\u2014giving water\nto the\u2014\u201d Someone shushed her.\nThe Duke looked at Kynes, noting that the planetologist wore an old-style\ndark brown uniform with epaulets of the Imperial Civil Servant and a tiny\ngold teardrop of rank at his collar.\nThe water-shipper asked in an angry voice: \u201cDoes the Duke imply\ncriticism of our custom?\u201d\n\u201cThis custom has been changed,\u201d Leto said. He nodded to Kynes, marked\nthe frown on Jessica\u2019s face, thought: A frown does not become her, but it\u2019ll\nincrease rumors of friction between us.\n\u201cWith the Duke\u2019s permission,\u201d the water-shipper said, \u201cI\u2019d like to inquire\nfurther about customs.\u201d\nLeto heard the sudden oily tone in the man\u2019s voice, noted the watchful\nsilence in this group, the way heads were beginning to turn toward them\naround the room.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it almost time for dinner?\u201d Jessica asked.\n\u201cBut our guest has some questions,\u201d Leto said. And he looked at the water-\nshipper, seeing a round-faced man with large eyes and thick lips, recalling\nHawat\u2019s memorandum: \u201c... and this watershipper is a man to watch\u2014Lingar\nBewt, remember the name. The Harkonnens used him but never fully\ncontrolled him. \u201d\n\u201cWater customs are so interesting,\u201d Bewt said, and there was a smile on his\nface. \u201cI\u2019m curious what you intend about the conservatory attached to this\nhouse. Do you intend to continue flaunting it in the people\u2019s faces...\nm\u2019Lord?\u201d\nLeto held anger in check, staring at the man. Thoughts raced through his\nmind. It had taken bravery to challenge him in his own ducal castle,\nespecially since they now had Bewt\u2019s signature over a contract of allegiance.\nThe action had taken, also, a knowledge of personal power. Water was,\nindeed, power here. If water facilities were mined, for instance, ready to be\ndestroyed at a signal.... The man looked capable of such a thing. Destruction\nof water facilities might well destroy Arrakis. That could well have been the\nclub this Bewt held over the Harkonnens.\n\u201cMy Lord, the Duke, and I have other plans for our conservatory,\u201d Jessica\nsaid. She smiled at Leto. \u201cWe intend to keep it, certainly, but only to hold it\nin trust for the people of Arrakis. It is our dream that someday the climate of\nArrakis may be changed sufficiently to grow such plants anywhere in the\nopen.\u201d\nBless her! Leto thought. Let our water-shipper chew on that.\n\u201cYour interest in water and weather control is obvious,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cI\u2019d advise you to diversify your holdings. One day, water will not be a\nprecious commodity on Arrakis.\u201d\nAnd he thought: Hawat must redouble his efforts at infiltrating this Bewt\u2019s\norganization. And we must start on stand-by water facilities at once. No man\nis going to hold a club over my head!\nBewt nodded, the smile still on his face. \u201cA commendable dream, my\nLord.\u201d He withdrew a pace.\nLeto\u2019s attention was caught by the expression on Kynes\u2019 face. The man\nwas staring at Jessica. He appeared transfigured\u2014like a man in love ... or\ncaught in a religious trance.\nKynes\u2019 thoughts were overwhelmed at last by the words of prophecy:\n\u201cAnd they shall share your most precious dream. \u201d He spoke directly to\nJessica: \u201cDo you bring the shortening of the way?\u201d\n\u201cAh, Dr. Kynes,\u201d the water-shipper said. \u201cYou\u2019ve come in from tramping\naround with your mobs of Fremen. How gracious of you.\u201d\nKynes passed an unreadable glance across Bewt, said: \u201cIt is said in the\ndesert that possession of water in great amount can inflict a man with fatal\ncarelessness.\u201d\n\u201cThey have many strange sayings in the desert,\u201d Bewt said, but his voice\nbetrayed uneasiness.\nJessica crossed to Leto, slipped her hand under his arm to gain a moment\nin which to calm herself. Kynes had said: \u201c...the shortening of the way.\u201d In\nthe old tongue, the phrase translated as \u201cKwisatz Haderach.\u201d The\nplanetologist\u2019s odd question seemed to have gone unnoticed by the others,\nand now Kynes was bending over one of the consort women, listening to a\nlow-voiced coquetry.\nKwisatz Haderach, Jessica thought. Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant\nthat legend here, too? The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul. He could\nbe the Kwisatz Haderach. He could be.\nThe Guild Bank representative had fallen into conversation with the water-\nshipper, and Bewt\u2019s voice lifted above the renewed hum of conversations:\n\u201cMany people have sought to change Arrakis.\u201d\nThe Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the\nplanetologist upright and away from the flirting woman.\nInto the sudden silence, a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared\nhis throat behind Leto, said: \u201cDinner is served, my Lord.\u201d\nThe Duke directed a questioning glance down at Jessica.\n\u201cThe custom here is for host and hostess to follow their guests to table,\u201d\nshe said, and smiled: \u201cShall we change that one, too, my Lord?\u201d\nHe spoke coldly: \u201cThat seems a goodly custom. We shall let it stand for\nnow.\u201d\nThe illusion that I suspect her of treachery must be maintained, he thought.\nHe glanced at the guests filing past them. Who among you believes this lie?\nJessica, sensing his remoteness, wondered at it as she had done frequently\nthe past week. He acts like a man struggling with himself, she thought. Is it\nbecause I moved so swiftly setting up this dinner party? Yet, he knows how\nimportant it is that we begin to mix our officers and men with the locals on a\nsocial plane. We are father and mother surrogate to them all. Nothing\nimpresses that fact more firmly than this sort of social sharing.\nLeto, watching the guests file past, recalled what Thufir Hawat had said\nwhen informed of the affair: \u201cSire! I forbid it!\u201d\nA grim smile touched the Duke\u2019s mouth. What a scene that had been. And\nwhen the Duke had remained adamant about attending the dinner, Hawat had\nshaken his head. \u201cI have bad feelings about this, my Lord,\u201d he\u2019d said.\n\u201cThings move too swiftly on Arrakis. That\u2019s not like the Harkonnens. Not\nlike them at all.\u201d\nPaul passed his father escorting a young woman half a head taller than\nhimself. He shot a sour glance at his father, nodded at something the young\nwoman said.\n\u201cHer father manufactures stillsuits,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cI\u2019m told that only a fool\nwould be caught in the deep desert wearing one of the man\u2019s suits.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s the man with the scarred face ahead of Paul?\u201d the Duke asked. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t place him.\u201d\n\u201cA late addition to the list,\u201d she whispered. \u201cGurney arranged the\ninvitation. Smuggler.\u201d\n\u201cGurney arranged?\u201d\n\u201cAt my request. It was cleared with Hawat, althought I thought Hawat was\na little stiff about it. The smuggler\u2019s called Tuek, Esmar Tuek. He\u2019s a power\namong his kind. They all know him here. He\u2019s dined at many of the houses.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is he here?\u201d\n\u201cEveryone here will ask that question,\u201d she said. \u201cTuek will sow doubt and\nsuspicion just by his presence. He\u2019ll also serve notice that you\u2019re prepared to\nback up your orders against graft\u2014by enforcement from the smugglers\u2019 end\nas well. This was the point Hawat appeared to like.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I like it.\u201d He nodded to a passing couple, saw only a few of\ntheir guests remained to precede them. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you invite some\nFremen?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s Kynes,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s Kynes,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you arranged any other little\nsurprises for me?\u201d He led her into step behind the procession.\n\u201cAll else is most conventional,\u201d she said.\nAnd she thought: My darling, can\u2019t you see that this smuggler controls fast\nships, that he can be bribed? We must have a way out, a door of escape from\nA rrakis if all else fails us here.\nAs they emerged into the dining hall, she disengaged her arm, allowed\nLeto to seat her. He strode to his end of the table. A footman held his chair\nfor him. The others settled with a swishing of fabrics, a scraping of chairs,\nbut the Duke remained standing. He gave a hand signal, and the house\ntroopers in footman uniform around the table stepped back, standing at\nattention.\nUneasy silence settled over the room.\nJessica, looking down the length of the table, saw a faint trembling at the\ncorners of Leto\u2019s mouth, noted the dark flush of anger on his cheeks. What\nhas angered him? she asked herself. Surely not my invitation to the smuggler.\n\u201cSome question my changing of the laving basin custom,\u201d Leto said. \u201cThis\nis my way of telling you that many things will change.\u201d\nEmbarrassed silence settled over the table.\nThey think him drunk, Jessica thought.\nLeto lifted his water flagon, held it aloft where the suspensor lights shot\nbeams of reflection off it. \u201cAs a Chevalier of the Imperium, then,\u201d he said, \u201cI\ngive you a toast.\u201d\nThe others grasped their flagons, all eyes focused on the Duke. In the\nsudden stillness, a suspensor light drifted slightly in an errant breeze from the\nserving kitchen hallway. Shadows played across the Duke\u2019s hawk features.\n\u201cHere I am and here I remain!\u201d he barked.\nThere was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouths\u2014stopped as\nthe Duke remained with arm upraised. \u201cMy toast is one of those maxims so\ndear to our hearts: \u2018Business makes progress! Fortune passes everywhere!\u2019 \u201d\nHe sipped his water.\nThe others joined him. Questioning glances passed among them.\n\u201cGurney!\u201d the Duke called.\nFrom an alcove at Leto\u2019s end of the room came Halleck\u2019s voice. \u201cHere, my\nLord.\u201d\n\u201cGive us a tune, Gurney.\u201d\nA minor chord from the baliset floated out of the alcove. Servants began\nputting plates of food on the table at the Duke\u2019s gesture releasing them\u2014\nroast desert hare in sauce cepeda, aplomage sirian, chukka under glass, coffee\nwith melange (a rich cinnamon odor from the spice wafted across the table), a\ntrue pot-a-oie served with sparkling Caladan wine.\nStill, the Duke remained standing.\nAs the guests waited, their attention torn between the dishes placed before\nthem and the standing Duke, Leto said: \u201cIn olden times, it was the duty of the\nhost to entertain his guests with his own talents.\u201d His knuckles turned white,\nso fiercely did he grip his water flagon. \u201cI cannot sing, but I give you the\nwords of Gurney\u2019s song. Consider it another toast\u2014a toast to all who\u2019ve died\nbringing us to this station.\u201d\nAn uncomfortable stirring sounded around the table.\nJessica lowered her gaze, glanced at the people seated nearest her\u2014there\nwas the round-faced water-shipper and his woman, the pale and austere Guild\nBank representative (he seemed a whistlefaced scarecrow with his eyes fixed\non Leto), the rugged and scar-faced Tuek, his blue-within-blue eyes\ndowncast.\n\u201cReview, friends\u2014troops long past review,\u201d the Duke intoned. \u201cAll to fate\na weight of pains and dollars. Their spirits wear our silver collars. Review,\nfriends\u2014troops long past review: Each a dot of time without pretense or\nguile. With them passes the lure of fortune. Review, friends\u2014troops long\npast review. When our time ends on its rictus smile, we\u2019ll pass the lure of\nfortune.\u201d\nThe Duke allowed his voice to trail off on the last line, took a deep drink\nfrom his water flagon, slammed it back onto the table. Water slopped over the\nbrim onto the linen.\nThe others drank in embarrassed silence.\nAgain, the Duke lifted his water flagon, and this time emptied its\nremaining half onto the floor, knowing that the others around the table must\ndo the same.\nJessica was first to follow his example.\nThere was a frozen moment before the others began emptying their\nflagons. Jessica saw how Paul, seated near his father, was studying the\nreactions around him. She found herself also fascinated by what her guests\u2019\nactions revealed\u2014especially among the women. This was clean, potable\nwater, not something already cast away in a sopping towel. Reluctance to just\ndiscard it exposed itself in trembling hands, delayed reactions, nervous\nlaughter... and violent obedience to the necessity. One woman dropped her\nflagon, looked the other way as her male companion recovered it.\nKynes, though, caught her attention most sharply. The planetologist\nhesitated, then emptied his flagon into a container beneath his jacket. He\nsmiled at Jessica as he caught her watching him, raised the empty flagon to\nher in a silent toast. He appeared completely unembarrassed by his action.\nHalleck\u2019s music still wafted over the room, but it had come out of its minor\nkey, lilting and lively now as though he were trying to lift the mood.\n\u201cLet the dinner commence,\u201d the Duke said, and sank into his chair.\nHe\u2019s angry and uncertain, Jessica thought. The loss of that factory crawler\nhit him more deeply than it should have. It must be something more than that\nloss. He acts like a desperate man. She lifted her fork, hoping in the motion\nto hide her own sudden bitterness. Why not? He is desperate.\nSlowly at first, then with increasing animation, the dinner got under way.\nThe stillsuit manufacturer complimented Jessica on her chef and wine.\n\u201cWe brought both from Caladan,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSuperb!\u201d he said, tasting the chukka. \u201cSimply superb! And not a hint of\nmelange in it. One gets so tired of the spice in everything.\u201d\nThe Guild Bank representative looked across at Kynes. \u201cI understand,\nDoctor Kynes, that another factory crawler has been lost to a worm.\u201d\n\u201cNews travels fast,\u201d the Duke said.\n\u201cThen it\u2019s true?\u201d the banker asked, shifting his attention to Leto.\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s true!\u201d the Duke snapped. \u201cThe blasted carry-all\ndisappeared. It shouldn\u2019t be possible for anything that big to disappear!\u201d\n\u201cWhen the worm came, there was nothing to recover the crawler,\u201d Kynes\nsaid.\n\u201cIt should not be possible!\u201d the Duke repeated.\n\u201cNo one saw the carryall leave?\u201d the banker asked.\n\u201cSpotters customarily keep their eyes on the sand,\u201d Kynes said. \u201cThey\u2019re\nprimarily interested in wormsign. A carryall\u2019s complement usually is four\nmen\u2014two pilots and two journeymen attachers. If one\u2014or even two of this\ncrew were in the pay of the Duke\u2019s foes\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAh-h-h, I see,\u201d the banker said. \u201cAnd you, as Judge of the Change, do you\nchallenge this?\u201d\n\u201cI shall have to consider my position carefully,\u201d Kynes said, \u201cand I\ncertainly will not discuss it at table.\u201d And he thought: That pale skeleton of a\nman! He knows this is the kind of infraction I was instructed to ignore.\nThe banker smiled, returned his attention to his food.\nJessica sat remembering a lecture from her Bene Gesserit school days. The\nsubject had been espionage and counter-espionage. A plump, happy-faced\nReverend Mother had been the lecturer, her jolly voice contrasting weirdly\nwith the subject matter.\nA thing to note about any espionage and/or counter-espionage school is\nthe similar basic reaction pattern of all its graduates. Any enclosed discipline\nsets its stamp, its pattern, upon its students. That pattern is susceptible to\nanalysis and prediction.\nNow, motivational patterns are going to be similar among all espionage\nagents. That is to say: there will be certain types of motivation that are\nsimilar despite differing schools or opposed aims. You will study first how to\nseparate this element for your analysis\u2014in the beginning, through\ninterrogation patterns that betray the inner orientation of the interrogators;\nsecondly, by close observation of language-thought orientation of those\nunder analysis. You will find it fairly simple to determine the root languages\nof your subjects, of course, both through voice inflection and speech pattern.\nNow, sitting at table with her son and her Duke and their guests, hearing\nthat Guild Bank representative, Jessica felt a chill of realization: the man was\na Harkonnen agent. He had the Giedi Prime speech pattern\u2014subtly masked,\nbut exposed to her trained awareness as though he had announced himself.\nDoes this mean the Guild itself has taken sides against House Atreides?\nshe asked herself. The thought shocked her, and she masked her emotion by\ncalling for a new dish, all the while listening for the man to betray his\npurpose. He will shift the conversation next to something seemingly innocent,\nbut with ominous overtones, she told herself. It\u2019s his pattern.\nThe banker swallowed, took a sip of wine, smiled at something said to him\nby the woman on his right. He seemed to listen for a moment to a man down\nthe table who was explaining to the Duke that native Arrakeen plants had no\nthorns.\n\u201cI enjoy watching the flights of birds on Arrakis,\u201d the banker said,\ndirecting his words at Jessica. \u201cAll of our birds, of course, are carrion-eaters,\nand many exist without water, having become blood-drinkers.\u201d\nThe stillsuit manufacterer\u2019s daughter, seated between Paul and his father at\nthe other end of the table, twisted her pretty face into a frown, said: \u201cOh,\nSoo-Soo, you say the most disgusting things.\u201d\nThe banker smiled. \u201cThey call me Soo-Soo because I\u2019m financial adviser\nto the Water Peddlers Union.\u201d And, as Jessica continued to look at him\nwithout comment, he added: \u201cBecause of the water-sellers\u2019 cry\u2014\u2018Soo-Soo\nSook!\u2019 \u201d And he imitated the call with such accuracy that many around the\ntable laughed.\nJessica heard the boastful tone of voice, but noted most that the young\nwoman had spoken on cue\u2014a set piece. She had produced the excuse for the\nbanker to say what he had said. She glanced at Lingar Bewt. The water\nmagnate was scowling, concentrating on his dinner. It came to Jessica that\nthe banker had said: \u201cI, too, control that ultimate source of power on Arrakis\n\u2014water. \u201d\nPaul had marked the falseness in his dinner companion\u2019s voice, saw that\nhis mother was following the conversation with Bene Gesserit intensity. On\nimpulse, he decided to play the foil, draw the exchange out. He addressed\nhimself to the banker.\n\u201cDo you mean, sir, that these birds are cannibals?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s an odd question, young Master,\u201d the banker said. \u201cI merely said\nthe birds drink blood. It doesn\u2019t have to be the blood of their own kind, does\nit?\u201d\n\u201cIt was not an odd question,\u201d Paul said, and Jessica noted the brittle riposte\n"
