    "userPrompt": "believes he’s given the Duke your spice planet. How poignant.”\n“That’s a nonsensical statement,” the Baron rumbled. “You say this to\nconfuse young Feyd-Rautha, but it is not necessary to confuse my nephew.”\nThe sullen-faced youth stirred in his chair, smoothed a wrinkle in the black\nleotards he wore. He sat upright as a discreet tapping sounded at the door in\nthe wall behind him.\nPiter unfolded from his chair, crossed to the door, cracked it wide enough\nto accept a message cylinder. He closed the door, unrolled the cylinder and\nscanned it. A chuckle sounded from him. Another.\n“Well?” the Baron demanded.\n“The fool answered us, Baron!”\n“Whenever did an Atreides refuse the opportunity for a gesture?” the\nBaron asked. “Well, what does he say?”\n“He’s most uncouth, Baron. Addresses you as ‘Harkonnen’-no ‘Sire et\nCher Cousin,’ no title, nothing.”\n“It’s a good name,” the Baron growled, and his voice betrayed his\nimpatience. “What does dear Leto say?”\n“He says: ‘Your offer of a meeting is refused. I have ofttimes met your\ntreachery and this all men know.’ ”\n“And?” the Baron asked.\n“He says: ‘The art of kanly still has admirers in the Empire.’ He signs it:\n‘Duke Leto of Arrakis.’ ” Piter began to laugh. “Of Arrakis! Oh, my! This is\nalmost too rich!”\n“Be silent, Piter,” the Baron said, and the laughter stopped as though shut\noff with a switch. “Kanly, is it?” the Baron asked. “Vendetta, heh? And he\nuses the nice old word so rich in tradition to be sure I know he means it.”\n“You made the peace gesture,” Piter said. “The forms have been obeyed.”\n“For a Mentat, you talk too much, Piter,” the Baron said. And he thought: I\nmust do away with that one soon. He has almost outlived his usefulness. The\nBaron stared across the room at his Mentat assassin, seeing the feature about\nhim that most people noticed first: the eyes, the shaded slits of blue within\nblue, the eyes without any white in them at all.\nA grin flashed across Piter’s face. It was like a mask grimace beneath those\neyes like holes. “But, Baron! Never has revenge been more beautiful. It is to\nsee a plan of the most exquisite treachery: to make Leto exchange Caladan\nfor Dune—and without alternative because the Emperor orders it. How\nwaggish of you!”\nIn a cold voice, the Baron said: “You have a flux of the mouth, Piter.”\n“But I am happy, my Baron. Whereas you ... you are touched by jealousy.”\n“Piter!”\n“Ah-ah, Baron! Is it not regrettable you were unable to devise this\ndelicious scheme by yourself?”\n“Someday I will have you strangled, Piter.”\n“Of a certainty, Baron. Enfin! But a kind act is never lost, eh?”\n“Have you been chewing verite or semuta, Piter?”\n“Truth without fear surprises the Baron,” Piter said. His face drew down\ninto a caricature of a frowning mask. “Ah, hah! But you see, Baron, I know\nas a Mentat when you will send the executioner. You will hold back just so\nlong as I am useful. To move sooner would be wasteful and I’m yet of much\nuse. I know what it is you learned from that lovely Dune planet—waste not.\nTrue, Baron?”\nThe Baron continued to stare at Piter.\nFeyd-Rautha squirmed in his chair. These wrangling fools! he thought. My\nuncle cannot talk to his Mentat without arguing. Do they think I’ve nothing to\ndo except listen to their arguments?\n“Feyd,” the Baron said. “I told you to listen and learn when I invited you in\nhere. Are you learning?”\n“Yes, Uncle.” the voice was carefully subservient.\n“Sometimes I wonder about Piter,” the Baron said. “I cause pain out of\nnecessity, but he ... I swear he takes a positive delight in it. For myself, I can\nfeel pity toward the poor Duke Leto. Dr. Yueh will move against him soon,\nand that’ll be the end of all the Atreides. But surely Leto will know whose\nhand directed the pliant doctor ... and knowing that will be a terrible thing.”\n“Then why haven’t you directed the doctor to slip a kindjal between his\nribs quietly and efficiently?” Piter asked. “You talk of pity, but—”\n“The Duke must know when I encompass his doom,” the Baron said. “And\nthe other Great Houses must learn of it. The knowledge will give them pause.\nI’ll gain a bit more room to maneuver. The necessity is obvious, but I don’t\nhave to like it.”\n“Room to maneuver,” Piter sneered. “Already you have the Emperor’s\neyes on you, Baron. You move too boldly. One day the Emperor will send a\nlegion or two of his Sardaukar down here onto Giedi Prime and that’ll be an\nend to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.”\n“You’d like to see that, wouldn’t you, Piter?” the Baron asked. “You’d\nenjoy seeing the Corps of Sardaukar pillage through my cities and sack this\ncastle. You’d truly enjoy that.”\n“Does the Baron need to ask?” Piter whispered.\n“You should’ve been a Bashar of the Corps,” the Baron said. “You’re too\ninterested in blood and pain. Perhaps I was too quick with my promise of the\nspoils of Arrakis.”\nPiter took five curiously mincing steps into the room, stopped directly\nbehind Feyd-Rautha. There was a tight air of tension in the room, and the\nyouth looked up at Piter with a worried frown.\n“Do not toy with Piter, Baron,” Piter said. “You promised me the Lady\nJessica. You promised her to me.”\n“For what, Piter?” the Baron asked. “For pain?”\nPiter stared at him, dragging out the silence.\nFeyd-Rautha moved his suspensor chair to one side, said: “Uncle, do I\nhave to stay? You said you’d—”\n“My darling Feyd-Rautha grows impatient,” the Baron said. He moved\nwithin the shadows beside the globe. “Patience, Feyd.” And he turned his\nattention back to the Mentat. “What of the Dukeling, the child Paul, my dear\nPiter?”\n“The trap will bring him to you, Baron,” Piter muttered.\n“That’s not my question,” the Baron said. “You’ll recall that you predicted\nthe Bene Gesserit witch would bear a daughter to the Duke. You were wrong,\neh, Mentat?”\n“I’m not often wrong, Baron,” Piter said, and for the first time there was\nfear in his voice. “Give me that: I’m not often wrong. And you know yourself\nthese Bene Gesserit bear mostly daughters. Even the Emperor’s consort had\nproduced only females.”\n“Uncle,” said Feyd-Rautha, “you said there’d be something important here\nfor me to—”\n“Listen to my nephew,” the Baron said. “He aspires to rule my Barony, yet\nhe cannot rule himself.” The Baron stirred beside the globe, a shadow among\nshadows. “Well then, Feyd-Rautha Harkonne, I summoned you here hoping\nto teach you a bit of wisdom. Have you observed our good Mentat? You\nshould’ve learned something from this exchange.”\n“But, Uncle—”\n“A most efficient Mentat, Piter, wouldn’t you say, Feyd?”\n“Yes, but—”\n“Ah! Indeed but! But he consumes too much spice, eats it like candy. Look\nat his eyes! He might’ve come directly from the Arrakeen labor pool.\nEfficient, Piter, but he’s still emotional and prone to passionate outbursts.\nEfficient, Piter, but he still can err.”\nPiter spoke in a low, sullen tone: “Did you call me in here to impair my\nefficiency with criticism, Baron?”\n“Impair your efficiency? You know me better, Piter. I wish only for my\nnephew to understand the limitations of a Mentat.”\n“Are you already training my replacement?” Piter demanded.\n“Replace you? Why, Piter, where could I find another Mentat with your\ncunning and venom?”\n“The same place you found me, Baron.”\n“Perhaps I should at that,” the Baron mused. “You do seem a bit unstable\nlately. And the spice you eat!”\n“Are my pleasures too expensive, Baron? Do you object to them?”\n“My dear Piter, your pleasures are what tie you to me. How could I object\nto that? I merely wish my nephew to observe this about you.”\n“Then I’m on display,” Piter said. “Shall I dance? Shall I perform my\nvarious functions for the eminent Feyd-Rau—”\n“Precisely,” the Baron said. “You are on display. Now, be silent.” He\nglanced at Feyd-Rautha, noting his nephew’s lips, the full and pouting look\nof them, the Harkonnen genetic marker, now twisted slightly in amusement.\n“This is a Mentat, Feyd. It has been trained and conditioned to perform\ncertain duties. The fact that it’s encased in a human body, however, must not\nbe overlooked. A serious drawback, that. I sometimes think the ancients with\ntheir thinking machines had the right idea.”\n“They were toys compared to me,” Piter snarled. “You yourself, Baron,\ncould outperform those machines.”\n“Perhaps,” the Baron said. “Ah, well....” He took a deep breath, belched.\n“Now, Piter, outline for my nephew the salient features of our campaign\nagainst the House of Atreides. Function as a Mentat for us, if you please.”\n“Baron, I’ve warned you not to trust one so young with this information.\nMy observations of—”\n“I’ll be the judge of this,” the Baron said. “I give you an order, Mentat.\nPerform one of your various functions.”\n“So be it,” Piter said. He straightened, assuming an odd attitude of dignity\n—as though it were another mask, but this time clothing his entire body. “In a\nfew days Standard, the entire household of the Duke Leto will embark on a\nSpacing Guild liner for Arrakis. The Guild will deposit them at the city of\nArrakeen rather than at our city of Carthag. The Duke’s Mentat, Thufir\nHawat, will have concluded rightly that Arrakeen is easier to defend.”\n“Listen carefully, Feyd,” the Baron said. “Observe the plans within plans\nwithin plans.”\nFeyd-Rautha nodded, thinking: This is more like it. The old monster is\nletting me in on secret things at last. He must really mean for me to be his\nheir.\n“There are several tangential possibilities,” Piter said. “I indicate that\nHouse Atreides will go to Arrakis. We must not, however, ignore the\npossibility the Duke has contracted with the Guild to remove him to a place\nof safety outside the System. Others in like circumstances have become\nrenegade Houses, taking family atomics and shields and fleeing beyond the\nImperium.”\n“The Duke’s too proud a man for that,” the Baron said.\n“It is a possibility,” Piter said. “The ultimate effect for us would be the\nsame, however.”\n“No, it would not!” the Baron growled. “I must have him dead and his line\nended.”\n“That’s the high probability,” Piter said. “There are certain preparations\nthat indicate when a House is going renegade. The Duke appears to be doing\nnone of these things.”\n“So,” the Baron sighed. “Get on with it, Piter.\n“At Arrakeen,” Piter said, “the Duke and his family will occupy the\nResidency, lately the home of Count and Lady Fenring.”\n“The Ambassador to the Smugglers,” the Baron chuckled.\n“Ambassador to what?” Feyd-Rautha asked.\n“Your uncle makes a joke,” Piter said. “He calls Count Fenring\nAmbassador to the Smugglers, indicating the Emperor’s interest in smuggling\noperations on Arrakis.”\nFeyd-Rautha turned a puzzled stare on his uncle. “Why?”\n“Don’t be dense, Feyd,” the Baron snapped. “As long as the Guild remains\neffectively outside Imperial control, how could it be otherwise? How else\ncould spies and assassins move about?”\nFeyd-Rautha’s mouth made a soundless “Oh-h-h-h.”\n“We’ve arranged diversions at the Residency,” Piter said. “There’ll be an\nattempt on the life of the Atreides heir—an attempt which could succeed.”\n“Piter,” the Baron rumbled, “you indicated—”\n“I indicated accidents can happen,” Piter said. “And the attempt must\nappear valid.”\n“Ah, but the lad has such a sweet young body,” the Baron said. “Of course,\nhe’s potentially more dangerous than the father ... with that witch mother\ntraining him. Accursed woman! Ah, well, please continue, Piter.”\n“Hawat will have divined that we have an agent planted on him,” Piter\nsaid. “The obvious suspect is Dr. Yueh, who is indeed our agent. But Hawat\nhas investigated and found that our doctor is a Suk School graduate with\nImperial Conditioning—supposedly safe enough to minister even to the\nEmperor. Great store is set on Imperial Conditioning. It’s assumed that\nultimate conditioning cannot be removed without killing the subject.\nHowever, as someone once observed, given the right lever you can move a\nplanet. We found the lever that moved the doctor.”\n“How?” Feyd-Rautha asked. He found this a fascinating subject. Everyone\nknew you couldn’t subvert Imperial Conditioning!\n“Another time,” the Baron said. “Continue, Piter.”\n“In place of Yueh,” Piter said, “we’ll drag a most interesting suspect across\nHawat’s path. The very audacity of this suspect will recommend her to\nHawat’s attention.”\n“Her?” Feyd-Rautha asked.\n“The Lady Jessica herself,” the Baron said.\n“Is it not sublime?” Piter asked. “Hawat’s mind will be so filled with this\nprospect it’ll impair his function as a Mentat. He may even try to kill her.”\nPiter frowned, then: “But I don’t think he’ll be able to carry it off.”\n“You don’t want him to, eh?” the Baron asked.\n“Don’t distract me,” Piter said. “While Hawat’s occupied with the Lady\nJessica, we’ll divert him further with uprisings in a few garrison towns and\nthe like. These will be put down. The Duke must believe he’s gaining a\nmeasure of security. Then, when the moment is ripe, we’ll signal Yueh and\nmove in with our major force ... ah....”\n“Go ahead, tell him all of it,” the Baron said.\n“We’ll move in strengthened by two legions of Sardaukar disguised in\nHarkonnen livery.”\n“Sardaukar!” Feyd-Rautha breathed. His mind focused on the dread\nImperial troops, the killers without mercy, the soldier-fanatics of the Padishah\nEmperor.\n“You see how I trust you, Feyd,” the Baron said. “No hint of this must ever\nreach another Great House, else the Landsraad might unite against the\nImperial House and there’d be chaos.”\n“The main point,” Piter said, “is this: since House Harkonnen is being used\nto do the Imperial dirty work, we’ve gained a true advantage. It’s a dangerous\nadvantage, to be sure, but if used cautiously, will bring House Harkonnen\ngreater wealth than that of any other House in the Imperium.”\n“You have no idea how much wealth is involved, Feyd,” the Baron said.\n“Not in your wildest imaginings. To begin, we’ll have an irrevocable\ndirectorship in the CHOAM Company.”\nFeyd-Rautha nodded. Wealth was the thing. CHOAM was the key to\nwealth, each noble House dipping from the company’s coffers whatever it\ncould under the power of the directorships. Those CHOAM directorships—\nthey were the real evidence of political power in the Imperium, passing with\nthe shifts of voting strength within the Landsraad as it balanced itself against\nthe Emperor and his supporters.\n“The Duke Leto,” Piter said, “may attempt to flee to the new Fremen scum\nalong the desert’s edge. Or he may try to send his family into that imagined\nsecurity. But that path is blocked by one of His Majesty’s agents—the\nplanetary ecologist. You may remember him—Kynes.”\n“Feyd remembers him,” the Baron said. “Get on with it.”\n“You do not drool very prettily, Baron,” Piter said.\n“Get on with it, I command you!” the Baron roared.\nPiter shrugged. “If matters go as planned,” he said, “House Harkonnen will\nhave a subfief on Arrakis within a Standard year. Your uncle will have\ndispensation of that fief. His own personal agent will rule on Arrakis.”\n“More profits,” Feyd-Rautha said.\n“Indeed,” the Baron said. And he thought: It’s only just. We’re the ones\nwho tamed Arrakis ... except for the few mongrel Fremen hiding in the skirts\nof the desert ... and some tame smugglers bound to the planet almost as\ntightly as the native laborpool.\n“And the Great Houses will know that the Baron has destroyed the\nAtreides,” Piter said. “They will know.”\n“They will know,” the Baron breathed.\n“Loveliest of all,” Piter said, “is that the Duke will know, too. He knows\nnow. He can already feel the trap.”\n“It’s true the Duke knows,” the Baron said, and his voice held a note of\nsadness. “He could not help but know ... more’s the pity.”\nThe Baron moved out and away from the globe of Arrakis. As he emerged\nfrom the shadows, his figure took on dimension—grossly and immensely fat.\nAnd with subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this\nfat was sustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh. He\nmight weigh two hundred Standard kilos in actuality, but his feet would carry\nno more than fifty of them.\n“I am hungry,” the Baron rumbled, and he rubbed his protruding lips with\na beringed hand, stared down at Feyd-Rautha through fat-enfolded eyes.\n“Send for food, my darling. We will eat before we retire.”\nThus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: “The Reverend Mother\nmust combine the seductive wiles of acourtesan with the\nuntouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these\nattributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure.\nFor when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the\nplace-between, once occupied by tension, has become a well-\nspring of cunning and resourcefulness.”\n—from“Muad’Dib, Family Commentaries” by the Princess Irulan\n“WELL, JESSICA, what have you to say for yourself?” asked the\nReverend Mother.\nIt was near sunset at Castle Caladan on the day of Paul’s ordeal. The two\nwomen were alone in Jessica’s morning room while Paul waited in the\nadjoining soundproofed Meditation Chamber.\nJessica stood facing the south windows. She saw and yet did not see the\nevening’s banked colors across meadow and river. She heard and yet did not\nhear the Reverend Mother’s question.\nThere had been another ordeal once—so many years ago. A skinny girl\nwith hair the color of bronze, her body tortured by the winds of puberty, had\nentered the study of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Proctor\nSuperior of the Bene Gesserit school on Wallach IX. Jessica looked down at\nher right hand, flexed the fingers, remembering the pain, the terror, the anger.\n“Poor Paul,” she whispered.\n“I asked you a question, Jessica!” The old woman’s voice was snappish,\ndemanding.\n“What? Oh....” Jessica tore her attention away from the past, faced the\nReverend Mother, who sat with back to the stone wall between the two west\nwindows. “What do you want me to say?”\n“What do I want you to say? What do I want you to say?” The old voice\ncarried a tone of cruel mimicry.\n“So I had a son!” Jessica flared. And she knew she was being goaded into\nthis anger deliberately.\n“You were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides.”\n“It meant so much to him,” Jessica pleaded.\n“And you in your pride thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach!”\nJessica lifted her chin. “I sensed the possibility.”\n“You thought only of your Duke’s desire for a son,” the old woman\nsnapped. “And his desires don’t figure in this. An Atreides daughter could’ve\nbeen wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. You’ve hopelessly\ncomplicated matters. We may lose both bloodlines now.”\n“You’re not infallible,” Jessica said. She braved the steady stare from the\nold eyes.\nPresently, the old woman muttered: “What’s done is done.”\n“I vowed never to regret my decision,” Jessica said.\n“How noble,” the Reverend Mother sneered. “No regrets. We shall see\nwhen you’re a fugitive with a price on your head and every man’s hand\nturned against you to seek your life and the life of your son.”\nJessica paled. “Is there no alternative?”\n“Alternative? A Bene Gesserit should ask that?”\n“I ask only what you see in the future with your superior abilities.”\n“I see in the future what I’ve seen in the past. You well know the pattern of\nour affairs, Jessica. The race knows its own mortality and fears stagnation of\nits heredity. It’s in the bloodstream—the urge to mingle genetic strains\nwithout plan. The Imperium, the CHOAM Company, all the Great Houses,\nthey are but bits of flotsam in the path of the flood.”\n“CHOAM,” Jessica muttered. “I suppose it’s already decided how they’ll\nredivide the spoils of Arrakis.”\n“What is CHOAM but the weather vane of our times,” the old woman said.\n“The Emperor and his friends now command fifty-nine point six-five per cent\nof the CHOAM directorship’s votes. Certainly they smell profits, and likely\nas others smell those same profits his voting strength will increase. This is the\npattern of history, girl.”\n“That’s certainly what I need right now,” Jessica said. “A review of\nhistory.”\n“Don’t be facetious, girl! You know as well as I do what forces surround\nus. We’ve a three-point civilization: the Imperial Household balanced against\nthe Federated Great Houses of the Landsraad, and between them, the Guild\nwith its damnable monopoly on interstellar transport. In politics, the tripod is\nthe most unstable of all structures. It’d be bad enough without the\ncomplication of a feudal trade culture which turns its back on most science.”\nJessica spoke bitterly: “Chips in the path of the flood—and this chip here,\nthis is the Duke Leto, and this one’s his son, and this one’s—”\n“Oh, shut up, girl. You entered this with full knowledge of the delicate\nedge you walked.”\n“ ‘I am Bene Gesserit: I exist only to serve,’ ” Jessica quoted.\n“Truth,” the old woman said. “And all we can hope for now is to prevent\n"
