    "userPrompt": "What had the Lady Jessica to sustain her in her time of\ntrial? Think you carefully on this Bene Gesserit proverb and\nperhaps you will see: \u201cAny road followed precisely to its end\nleads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to\ntest that it\u2019s a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you can\nnot see the mountain.\u201d\n\u2014from \u201cMuad\u2019Dib: Family Commentaries\u201d by the Princess Irulan\nAT THE end of the south wing, Jessica found a metal stair spiraling up to\nan oval door. She glanced back down the hall, again up at the door.\nOval? she wondered. What an odd shape for a door in a house.\nThrough the windows beneath the spiral stair she could see the great white\nsun of Arrakis moving on toward evening. Long shadows stabbed down the\nhall. She returned her attention to the stairs. Harsh sidelighting picked out\nbits of dried earth on the open metalwork of the steps.\nJessica put a hand on the rail, began to climb. The rail felt cold under her\nsliding palm. She stopped at the door, saw it had no handle, but there was a\nfaint depression on the surface of it where a handle should have been.\nSurely not a palm lock, she told herself. A palm lock must be keyed to one\nindividual\u2019s hand shape and palm lines. But it looked like a palm lock. And\nthere were ways to open any palm lock\u2014as she had learned at school.\nJessica glanced back to make certain she was unobserved, placed her palm\nagainst the depression in the door. The most gentle of pressures to distort the\nlines\u2014a turn of the wrist, another turn, a sliding twist of the palm across the\nsurface.\nShe felt the click.\nBut there were hurrying footsteps in the hall beneath her. Jessica lifted her\nhand from the door, turned, saw Mapes come to the foot of the stairs.\n\u201cThere are men in the great hall say they\u2019ve been sent by the Duke to get\nyoung master Paul,\u201d Mapes said. \u201cThey\u2019ve the ducal signet and the guard has\nidentified them.\u201d She glanced at the door, back to Jessica.\nA cautious one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. That\u2019s a good sign.\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the fifth room from this end of the hall, the small bedroom,\u201d\nJessica said. \u201cIf you have trouble waking him, call on Dr. Yueh in the next\nroom. Paul may require a wakeshot.\u201d\nAgain, Mapes cast a piercing stare at the oval door, and Jessica thought she\ndetected loathing in the expression. Before Jessica could ask about the door\nand what it concealed, Mapes had turned away, hurrying back down the hall.\nHawat certified this place, Jessica thought. There can\u2019t be anything too\nterrible in here.\nShe pushed the door. It swung inward onto a small room with another oval\ndoor opposite. The other door had a wheel handle.\nAn air lock! Jessica thought. She glanced down, saw a door prop fallen to\nthe floor of the little room. The prop carried Hawat\u2019s personal mark. The\ndoor was left propped open, she thought. Someone probably knocked the\nprop down accidentally, not realizing the outer door would close on a palm\nlock.\nShe stepped over the lip into the little room.\nWhy an airlock in a house? she asked herself. And she thought suddenly of\nexotic creatures sealed off in special climates.\nSpecial climate!\nThat would make sense on Arrakis where even the driest of off-planet\ngrowing things had to be irrigated.\nThe door behind her began swinging closed. She caught it and propped it\nopen securely with the stick Hawat had left. Again, she faced the wheel-\nlocked inner door, seeing now a faint inscription etched in the metal above\nthe handle. She recognized Galach words, read:\n\u201cO, Man! Here is a lovely portion of God\u2019s Creation; then, stand before it\nand learn to love the perfection of Thy Supreme Friend.\u201d\nJessica put her weight on the wheel. It turned left and the inner door\nopened. A gentle draft feathered her cheek, stirred her hair. She felt change in\nthe air, a richer taste. She swung the door wide, looked through into massed\ngreenery with yellow sunlight pouring across it.\nA yellow sun? she asked herself. Then: Filter glass!\nShe stepped over the sill and the door swung closed behind.\n\u201cA wet-planet conservatory,\u201d she breathed.\nPotted plants and low-pruned trees stood all about. She recognized a\nmimosa, a flowering quince, a sondagi, green-blossomed pleniscenta, green\nand white striped akarso ... roses....\nEven roses!\nShe bent to breathe the fragrance of a giant pink blossom, straightened to\npeer around the room.\nRhythmic noise invaded her senses.\nShe parted a jungle overlapping of leaves, looked through to the center of\nthe room. A low fountain stood there, small with fluted lips. The rhythmic\nnoise was a peeling, spooling arc of water falling thud-a-gallop onto the\nmetal bowl.\nJessica sent herself through the quick sense-clearing regimen, began a\nmethodical inspection of the room\u2019s perimeter. It appeared to be about ten\nmeters square. From its placement above the end of the hall and from subtle\ndifferences in construction, she guessed it had been added onto the roof of\nthis wing iong after the original building\u2019s completion.\nShe stopped at the south limits of the room in front of the wide reach of\nfilter glass, stared around. Every available space in the room was crowded\nwith exotic wet-climate plants. Something rustled in the greenery. She tensed,\nthen glimpsed a simple clock-set servok with pipe and hose arms. An arm\nlifted, sent out a fine spray of dampness that misted her cheeks. The arm\nretracted and she looked at what it had watered: a fern tree.\nWater everywhere in this room\u2014on a planet where water was the most\nprecious juice of life. Water being wasted so conspicuously that it shocked\nher to inner stillness.\nShe glanced out at the filter-yellowed sun. It hung low on a jagged horizon\nabove cliffs that formed part of the immense rock uplifting known as the\nShield Wall.\nFilter glass, she thought. To turn a white sun into something softer and\nmore familiar. Who could have built such a place? Leto? It would be like him\nto surprise me with such a gift, but there hasn\u2019t been time. And he\u2019s been\nbusy with more serious problems.\nShe recalled the report that many Arrakeen houses were sealed by airlock\ndoors and windows to conserve and reclaim interior moisture. Leto had said it\nwas a deliberate statement of power and wealth for this house to ignore such\nprecautions, its doors and windows being sealed only against the omnipresent\ndust.\nBut this room embodied a statement far more significant than the lack of\nwaterseals on outer doors. She estimated that this pleasure room used water\nenough to support a thousand persons on Arrakis\u2014possibly more.\nJessica moved along the window, continuing to stare into the room. The\nmove brought into view a metallic surface at table height beside the fountain\nand she glimpsed a white notepad and stylus there partly concealed by an\noverhanging fan leaf. She crossed to the table, noted Hawat\u2019s daysigns on it,\nstudied a message written on the pad:\n\u201cTO THE LADY JESSICA\u2014\nMay this place give you as much pleasure as it has given\nme. Please permit the room to convey a lesson we learned\nfrom the same teachers: the proximity of a desirable thing\ntempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.\nMy kindest wishes,\nMARGOT LADY FENRING\u201d\nJessica nodded, remembering that Leto had referred to the Emperor\u2019s\nformer proxy here as Count Fenring. But the hidden message of the note\ndemanded immediate attention, couched as it was in a way to inform her the\nwriter was another Bene Gesserit. A bitter thought touched Jessica in passing:\nThe Count married his Lady.\nEven as this thought flicked through her mind, she was bending to seek out\nthe hidden message. It had to be there. The visible note contained the code\nphrase every Bene Gesserit not bound by a School Injunction was required to\ngive another Bene Gesserit when conditions demanded it: \u201cOn that path lies\ndanger.\u201d\nJessica felt the back of the note, rubbed the surface for coded dots.\nNothing. The edge of the pad came under her seeking fingers. Nothing. She\nreplaced the pad where she had found it, feeling a sense of urgency.\nSomething in the position of the pad? she wondered.\nBut Hawat had been over this room, doubtless had moved the pad. She\nlooked at the leaf above the pad. The leaf! She brushed a finger along the\nunder surface, along the edge, along the stem. It was there! Her fingers\ndetected the subtle coded dots, scanned them in a single passage:\n\u201cYour son and the Duke are in immediate danger. A bedroom has been\ndesigned to attract your son. The H loaded it with death traps to be\ndiscovered, leaving one that may escape detection.\u201d Jessica put down the\nurge to run back to Paul; the full message had to be learned. Her fingers sped\nover the dots: \u201cI do not know the exact nature of the menace, but it has\nsomething to do with a bed. The threat to your Duke involves defection of a\ntrusted companion or lieutenant. The H plan to give you as gift to a minion.\nTo the best of my knowledge, this conservatory is safe. Forgive that I cannot\ntell more. My sources are few as my Count is not in the pay of the H. In\nhaste, MF.\u201d\nJessica thrust the leaf aside, whirled to dash back to Paul. In that instant,\nthe airlock door slammed open. Paul jumped through it, holding something in\nhis right hand, slammed the door behind him. He saw his mother, pushed\nthrough the leaves to her, glanced at the fountain, thrust his hand and the\nthing it clutched under the falling water.\n\u201cPaul!\u201d She grabbed his shoulder, staring at the hand. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\nHe spoke casually, but she caught the effort behind the tone: \u201cHunter-\nseeker. Caught it in my room and smashed its nose, but I want to be sure.\nWater should short it out.\u201d\n\u201cImmerse it!\u201d she commanded.\nHe obeyed.\nPresently, she said: \u201cWithdraw your hand. Leave the thing in the water.\u201d\nHe brought out his hand, shook water from it, staring at the quiescent metal\nin the fountain. Jessica broke off a plant stem, prodded the deadly sliver.\nIt was dead.\nShe dropped the stem into the water, looked at Paul. His eyes studied the\nroom with a searching intensity that she recognized\u2014the B.G. Way.\n\u201cThis place could conceal anything,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve reason to believe it\u2019s safe,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMy room was supposed to be safe, too. Hawat said\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt was a hunter-seeker,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cThat means someone inside\nthe house to operate it. Seeker control beams have a limited range. The thing\ncould\u2019ve been spirited in here after Hawat\u2019s investigation.\u201d\nBut she thought of the message of the leaf: \u201c... defection of a trusted\ncompanion or lieutenant. \u201d Not Hawat, surely. Oh, surely not Hawat.\n\u201cHawat\u2019s men are searching the house right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seeker\nalmost got the old woman who came to wake me.\u201d\n\u201cThe Shadout Mapes,\u201d Jessica said, remembering the encounter at the\nstairs. \u201cA summons from your father to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat can wait,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWhy do you think this room\u2019s safe?\u201d\nShe pointed to the note, explained about it.\nHe relaxed slightly.\nBut Jessica remained inwardly tense, thinking: A hunter-seeker! Merciful\nMother! It took all her training to prevent a fit of hysterical trembling.\nPaul spoke matter of factly: \u201cIt\u2019s the Harkonnens, of course. We shall have\nto destroy them.\u201d\nA rapping sounded at the airlock door\u2014the code knock of one of Hawat\u2019s\ncorps.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d Paul called.\nThe door swung wide and a tall man in Atreides uniform with a Hawat\ninsignia on his cap leaned into the room. \u201cThere you are, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cThe\nhousekeeper said you\u2019d be here.\u201d He glanced around the room. \u201cWe found a\ncairn in the cellar and caught a man in it. He had a seeker console.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll want to take part in the interrogation,\u201d Jessica said.\n\u201cSorry, my Lady. We messed him up catching him. He died.\u201d\n\u201cNothing to identify him?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found nothing yet, my Lady.\u201d\n\u201cWas he an Arrakeen native?\u201d Paul asked.\nJessica nodded at the astuteness of the question.\n\u201cHe has the native look,\u201d the man said. \u201cPut into that cairn more\u2019n a month\nago, by the look, and left there to await our coming. Stone and mortar where\nhe came through into the cellar were untouched when we inspected the place\nyesterday. I\u2019ll stake my reputation on it.\u201d\n\u201cNo one questions your thoroughness,\u201d Jessica said.\n\u201cI question it, my Lady. We should\u2019ve used sonic probes down there.\u201d\n\u201cI presume that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing now,\u201d Paul said.\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cSend word to my father that we\u2019ll be delayed.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, sir.\u201d He glanced at Jessica. \u201cIt\u2019s Hawat\u2019s order that under such\ncircumstances as these the young master be guarded in a safe place.\u201d Again,\nhis eyes swept the room. \u201cWhat of this place?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve reason to believe it safe,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth Hawat and I have inspected\nit.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll mount guard outside here, m\u2019Lady, until we\u2019ve been over the\nhouse once more.\u201d He bowed, touched his cap to Paul, backed out and swung\nthe door closed behind him.\nPaul broke the sudden silence, saying: \u201cHad we better go over the house\nlater ourselves? Your eyes might see things others would miss.\u201d\n\u201cThis wing was the only place I hadn\u2019t examined,\u201d she said. \u201cI put if off to\nlast because....\u201d\n\u201cBecause Hawat gave it his personal attention,\u201d he said.\nShe darted a quick look at his face, questioning.\n\u201cDo you distrust Hawat?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNo, but he\u2019s getting old ... he\u2019s overworked. We could take some of the\nload from him.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019d only shame him and impair his efficiency,\u201d she said. \u201cA stray\ninsect won\u2019t be able to wander into this wing after he hears about this. He\u2019ll\nbe shamed that....\u201d\n\u201cWe must take our own measures,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHawat has served three generations of Atreides with honor,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\ndeserves every respect and trust we can pay him ... many times over.\u201d\nPaul said: \u201cWhen my father is bothered by something you\u2019ve done he says\n\u2018Bene Gesserit!\u2019 like a swear word.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what is it about me that bothers your father?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you argue with him.\u201d\n\u201cYou are not your father, Paul.\u201d\nAnd Paul thought: It\u2019ll worry her, but I must tell her what that Mapes\nwoman said about a traitor among us.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you holding back?\u201d Jessica asked. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like you, Paul.\u201d\nHe shrugged, recounted the exchange with Mapes.\nAnd Jessica thought of the message of the leaf. She came to sudden\ndecision, showed Paul the leaf, told him its message.\n\u201cMy father must learn of this at once,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll radiograph it in code\nand get if off.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will wait until you can see him alone. As few as\npossible must learn about it.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean we should trust no one?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s another possibility,\u201d she said. \u201cThis message may have been\nmeant to get to us. The people who gave it to us may believe it\u2019s true, but it\nmay be that the only purpose was to get this message to us.\u201d\nPaul\u2019s face remained sturdily somber. \u201cTo sow distrust and suspicion in\nour ranks, to weaken us that way,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou must tell your father privately and caution him about this aspect of\nit,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI understand.\u201d\nShe turned to the tall reach of filter glass, stared out to the southwest where\nthe sun of Arrakis was sinking\u2014a yellowed ball above the cliffs.\nPaul turned with her, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s Hawat, either. Is it possible\nit\u2019s Yueh?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a lieutenant or companion,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I can assure you he\nhates the Harkonnens as bitterly as we do.\u201d\nPaul directed his attention to the cliffs, thinking: And it couldn\u2019t be\nGurney... or Duncan. Could it be one of the sub-lieutenants? Impossible.\nThey\u2019re all from families that\u2019ve been loyal to us for generations\u2014for good\nreason.\nJessica rubbed her forehead, sensing her own fatigue. So much peril here!\nShe looked out at the filter-yellowed landscape, studying it. Beyond the ducal\ngrounds stretched a high-fenced storage yard\u2014lines of spice silos in it with\nstilt-legged watchtowers standing around it like so many startled spiders. She\ncould see at least twenty storage yards of silos reaching out to the cliffs of the\nShield Wall\u2014silos repeated, stuttering across the basin.\nSlowly, the filtered sun buried itself beneath the horizon. Stars leaped out.\nShe saw one bright star so low on the horizon that it twinkled with a clear,\nprecise rhythm\u2014a trembling of light: blink-blink-blink-blink-blink ...\nPaul stirred beside her in the dusky room.\nBut Jessica concentrated on that single bright star, realizing that it was too\nlow, that it must come from the Shield Wall cliffs.\nSomeone signalling!\nShe tried to read the message, but it was in no code she had ever learned.\nOther lights had come on down on the plain beneath the cliffs: little\nyellows spaced out against blue darkness. And one light off to their left grew\nbrighter, began to wink back at the cliff\u2014very fast: blinksquirt, glimmer,\nblink!\nAnd it was gone.\nThe false star in the cliff winked out immediately.\nSignals ... and they filled her with premonition.\nWhy were lights used to signal across the basin? she asked herself. Why\ncouldn\u2019t they use the communications network?\nThe answer was obvious: the communinet was certain to be tapped now by\nagents of the Duke Leto. Light signals could only mean that messages were\nbeing sent between his enemies\u2014between Harkonnen agents.\nThere came a tapping at the door behind them and the voice of Hawat\u2019s\nman: \u201cAll clear, sir .. m\u2018Lady. Time to be getting the young master to his\nfather.\u201d\nIt is said that the Duke Leto blinded himself to the perils of\nArrakis, that he walked heedlessly into the pit. Would it not be\nmore likely to suggest he had lived so long in the presence of\nextreme danger he misjudged a change in its intensity? Or is it\npossible he deliberately sacrificed himself that his son might\nfind a better life? All evidence indicates the Duke was a man\nnot easily hoodwinked.\n\u2014from \u201cMuad\u2019Dib: Family Commentaries\u201d by the Princess Irulan\nTHE DUKE Leto Atreides leaned against a parapet of the landing control\ntower outside Arrakeen. The night\u2019s first moon, an oblate silver coin, hung\nwell above the southern horizon. Beneath it, the jagged cliffs of the Shield\nWall shone like parched icing through a dust haze. To his left, the lights of\nArrakeen glowed in the haze\u2014yellow ... white ... blue.\nHe thought of the notices posted now above his signature all through the\npopulous places of the planet: \u201cOur Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged\nme to take possession of this planet and end all dispute.\u201d\nThe ritualistic formality of it touched him with a feeling of loneliness. Who\nwas fooled by that fatuous legalism? Not the Fremen, certainly. Nor the\nHouses Minor who controlled the interior trade of Arrakis ... and were\nHarkonnen creatures almost to a man.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nThe rage was difficult to suppress.\nHe saw lights of a moving vehicle coming toward the landing field from\nArrakeen. He hoped it was the guard and troop carrier bringing Paul. The\ndelay was galling even though he knew it was prompted by caution on the\npart of Hawat\u2019s lieutenant.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nHe shook his head to drive out the angry thoughts, glanced back at the field\nwhere five of his own frigates were posted around the rim like monolithic\nsentries.\nBetter a cautious delay than ...\nThe lieutenant was a good one, he reminded himself. A man marked for\nadvancement, completely loyal.\n\u201cOur Sublime Padishah Emperor.... \u201d\nIf the people of this decadent garrison city could only see the Emperor\u2019s\nprivate note to his \u201cNoble Duke\u201d\u2014the disdainful allusions to veiled men and\nwomen: \u201c... but what else is one to expect of barbarians whose dearest dream\nis to live outside the ordered security of the faufreluches?\u201d\nThe Duke felt in this moment that his own dearest dream was to end all\nclass distinctions and never again think of deadly order. He looked up and out\nof the dust at the unwinking stars, thought: Around one of those little lights\ncircles Caladan ... but I\u2019ll never again see my home. The longing for Caladan\nwas a sudden pain in his breast. He felt that it did not come from within\nhimself, but that it reached out to him from Caladan. He could not bring\nhimself to call this dry wasteland of Arrakis his home, and he doubted he\never would.\nI must mask my feelings, he thought. For the boy\u2019s sake. If ever he\u2019s to\nhave a home, this must be it. I may think of Arrakis as a hell I\u2019ve reached\nbefore death, but he must find here that which will inspire him. There must be\nsomething.\nA wave of self-pity, immediately despised and rejected, swept through\nhim, and for some reason he found himself recalling two lines from a poem\nGurney Halleck often repeated\u2014\n\u201cMy lungs taste the air of Time \nBlown past falling sands....\u201d\nWell, Gurney would find plenty of falling sands here, the Duke thought.\nThe central wastelands beyond those moon-frosted cliffs were desert\u2014barren\nrock, dunes, and blowing dust, an uncharted dry wilderness with here and\nthere along its rim and perhaps scattered through it, knots of Fremen. If\nanything could buy a future for the Atreides line, the Fremen just might do it.\nProvided the Harkonnens hadn\u2019t managed to infect even the Fremen with\ntheir poisonous schemes.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nA scraping metal racket vibrated through the tower, shook the parapet\nbeneath his arms. Blast shutters dropped in front of him, blocking the view.\nShuttle\u2019s coming in, he thought. Time to go down and get to work. He\nturned to the stairs behind him, headed down to the big assembly room,\ntrying to remain calm as he descended, to prepare his face for the coming\nencounter.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nThe men were already boiling in from the field when he reached the\nyellow-domed room. They carried their spacebags over their shoulders,\nshouting and roistering like students returning from vacation.\n\u201cHey! Feel that under your dogs? That\u2019s gravity, man!\u201d \u201cHow many G\u2019s\ndoes this place pull? Feels heavy.\u201d \u201cNine-tenths of a G by the book.\u201d\n"
